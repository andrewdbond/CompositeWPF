    "Description": "Hi everyone, \n \nI was going through the MVVM Quick Start, and found that the code is quite different from the explanations in the Prism4.chm.\n \nE.g. the Prism4.chm says that there's a DataTemplateSelector.cs under \\MVVM\\MVVM\\Infrastructure\\ as the data template selector for the viewModels, \n \nwhile in the current version of the Quick Start, the selector is declared in the QuestionareView.xaml using  <prism:DataTemplateSelector />",
