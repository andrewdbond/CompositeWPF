    "Description": "The document of Prism 4 mentioned using the open source tool ManifestManagerUtility for ClickOnce to deploy WPF apps. It is really helpful. However the tool appears having some issues:\n \n1) The GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs file is missing from the zip file so the project can't be build; any solution or fix?\n \n2) The latest release is in 2008; any upcoming release for .NET 4?\n \n3) The sample code Prism 4 document mentioned is missing (Quickstarts\\Modularity\\ConfigurationModularity QuickStart solution); I assume the team is still working on it.\n \nTIA.",
