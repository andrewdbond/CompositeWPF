    "Description": "Hi Fernando,\n \nThanks for your reply. I will go through the links you provided.\n \nWhile analyzing the unit test project provided along with Prism setup, I came across \"Microsoft.Practices.Composite.TestSupport\" namespace,\n \nwhich is used for creating Mock objects for container, region manager etc... is there any documentation available for that.\n \n \n \nRegards,\n \nHarry",

      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nFor those interested in this subject, additionally to the links that Fernando Antivero suggested in this related thread (http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/222571), you could also find the following articles interesting:\r\n\r\nUnit Tests for ViewModels AND Views in Silverlight:\r\n\r\nhttp://csharperimage.jeremylikness.com/2009/12/unit-tests-for-viewmodels-and-views-in.html\r\n\r\nSilverlight Unit Testing Framework: Asynchronous Testing of Behaviors:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.wintellect.com/CS/blogs/jlikness/archive/2010/01/07/silverlight-unit-testing-framework-asynchronous-testing-of-behaviors.aspx\r\n\r\nAlso, I believe you could find useful information, on helper classes such as the PropertyChangeTracker tracker class in the following section of the Prism documentation, which provides guidance on unit testing application's view model and model classes, and on testing behaviors:\r\n\r\n6: Advanced MVVM Scenarios, Testing MVVM Applications:\r\n\r\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405494(v=pandp.40)#sec19\r\n\r\nAlso, regarding how to create mock objects, take into account that the Prism guidance doesn’t provide any particular information about it. However, for more detailed information about mocking, I believe you could check the following articles:\r\n\r\nExploring The Continuum Of Test Doubles \r\n\r\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163358.aspx\r\n\r\nAdvanced Unit Testing, Object Mocking, Profiling Your Apps and More \r\n\r\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc135981.aspx#S2\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nAgustin Adami\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami",
