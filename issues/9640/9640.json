      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nBased on my understanding of your scenario: if both your A1 and A2 views define the same region (e.g. \"TabRegion\") where the child views are added by using scoped region managers, you should be able to retrieve the active views in each of the parent views by benefiting from the Region's ActiveViews property. For example, this could be used in each of the Regions defined by each Scoped Region Manager like this: \r\n\r\nvar ViewA1ActiveView = scopedRegionManagerA1.Regions[\"InnerRegion\"].ActiveViews.FirstOrDefault();\r\n\r\nPlease let us now if we have misunderstood your scenario.\r\n\r\nAgustin Adami\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami",
