    "Description": "Hi\n \nOn a new machine with .NET 4 and VS 2010 and no previous versions of either, I just tried to build the ProjectLinker and got a host of errors which boiled down to the following:\n \nCould not resolve this reference. Could not locate the assembly \"Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.UnitTestFramework, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a, processorArchitecture=MSIL\". Check to make sure the assembly exists on disk. If this reference is required by your code, you may get compilation errors.\t\n \nMicrosoft.Practices.VisualStudio.UnitTestLibrary\n \nI resolved it by setting SpecificVersion to False.",
