    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI am trying to load multiple data entry views onto a single content region. On each View the data context (View Model) is bound to presentation objects. All the presentation objects together form a business object which will get saved to the database on a global command.\n\nThe problem here is achieving UI validation where on the global command, the Validation.ErrorTemplate should be visible for all the views on view activation. \n\nAny suggestions will be helpful.\n\nThanks,\nJeevan",
