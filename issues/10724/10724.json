    "Description": "If you make a TabControl and assign a region name for it, if you add EXACTLY one view for the regionname using RegionManager.RegisterViewWithRegion only the header of the first tab will be shown, not the content of the tab, i.e. the view is not being activated. If you add more than one view for the region name, the first tab is shown. It could seem like there's an error when EXACTLY one view is being added for the region name.\r\n\r\nIs it correct that there's such an error in PRISM.\r\n\r\nDo some of you know how to fix the error?\r\n\r\nThe attached solution in a zip file documents the problem. If you uncomment line 23 in the file PRISM50TabControlErrorModule.cs so an additional view is being added, the first view appears together with the new view.\r\n\r\nHow to solve this extremely annoying error?\r\n\r\n",
