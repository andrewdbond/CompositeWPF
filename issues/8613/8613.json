    "Description": "The navigation framework is excellent, but makes it really hard to debug when there's an issue with constructing a view model.  I had one object that I was injecting which couldn't be resolved (due to a bug), but because the view model was being constructed via a navigation request, the Unity exception that I would normally see was being swallowed by the RegionManager.  It would be good if the RegionManager didn't swallow these types of errors.  The solution at the moment is to debug the RegionManager to see te error, but this seems counter intuitive since the actual is error is external to the RegionManager and requires the project reference to be changed from the Prism DLLs to the Prism project.",
