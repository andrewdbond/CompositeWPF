    "Description": "The documentation for ConfigurationStore implies it will search all config files. The code seems to imply it too since it uses a foreach over the directory. The problem is it only returns the modules found for the first config file containing a modules section. My expectation from reading the documentation (and what I want it to do) is to return all the modules referenced in all config files for the directory.",

      "Message": "Hi,\r\nAs of Prism v4 documentation, there is no mention to the behavior youâ€™re explaining. Currently, the ConfigurationStore internally uses the ConfigurationManager class (http://msdn.microsoft.com/es-es/library/system.configuration.configurationmanager.aspx) to retrieve the specific Modules Section to configure the ModuleCatalog.\r\nIf you wish to implement a different behavior for that, you could create a different implementation of IConfigurationStore and create a different implementation of IModuleCatalog (similar to the ConfigurationModuleCatalog, but using your new implementation of IConfigurationStore).\r\nThank you for your feedback.\r\n\r\nMiguel Bronzovic\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic\r\n",
