    "Description": "The Silverlight Toolkit is now shipping with the extmap.xml files necessary to support assembly cacheing - is this something that can be done for Prism as well? Including Prism in the main shell XAP adds about 120kb, which isn't much, but it is a lot when your total XAP size is only 300kb. I wouldn't worry about it too much if they could at least be cached across multiple Silverlight apps, but currently I'm turning a 180kb XAP into a 300kb XAP to include Prism (it seems Unity is the biggest size culprit). This becomes a bigger issue when you are pushing out daily builds of the main XAP so that the browser's cacheing of the main XAP can never occur - having the Prism XAPs external to the main XAP could help out a good bit in that instance.\nÂ \nThanks for the consideration!",
