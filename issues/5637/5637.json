    "Description": "Prism is great, like a light in the dark... But to be able to use it it must be a flashlight I can bring everywhere (even in my bed to read a bit before sleepin !), not a reading lamp needing me to be glued to my desktop and my 2 monitors PC :-)\nSo supplying PDF will help a lot because most of ebook readers know how to display PDFs but not CHM files (at least my Sony PRS700 can't read CHM but sure all ebook readers are the same on this point).\nÂ \nThanks in advance !",
