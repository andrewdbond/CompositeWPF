      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nFor those concerned with this subject, I believe you could find the Prism 4 templates created by David Hill useful:\r\n - Prism Template Pack 1.4: Now with MEF Support! (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dphill/archive/2011/03/04/prism-template-pack-1-4-now-with-mef-support.aspx)\r\n\r\nHowever, take into account that, as far as I know, there is no official support for the aforementioned templates.\r\n\r\nWe are leaving this work item open as a suggestion so that the Prism team considers this for a future release\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDamian Cherubini\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini",
