    "Description": "\"We are currently developing 4 application suites with multiple targets:\n \nmobile \nWP7 \nmonodroid \nRIA \nsilverlight \nDesktop \nWPF \nWF (mostly form mono) \nASP.net \nFor proof of concept File Filtering in ProjectLinker is OK, but for real work we have hit the wall, because\ncustomization for each platform is needed.\n \nDue to the fact that we start with \"smaller' platform (mobile) and go toward bigger richer platforms\nexpanding/adding features, sometimes problems arise due to discrepancies between implementations..\n \nSimple case IsolatedStorage.GetFilenames()\n \nWP7 and SL \nIsolatedStorage.GetFilenames() \nIsolatedStorage.GetFilenames(string pattern) \nWPF (desktop version) \nIsolatedStorage.GetFilenames() \nThis case is simple because these are MS platforms and considered to be \"similar\". One can imagine\nhow tricky this can be when mono and it's derivatives come in  the game....\n \nThe feature of interest would be some kind of mapping between extension and project type, so that\nfiles with those extensions would not be linked to other target projects... Right now this is implemented\nfor *.Silverlight.cs and *.WPF.cs, but we need more and preferably in some kind of loadable settings xml.\n \nAny ideas when could we expect such support?\n \nWe are ready to help with this, tried even with source code from ProjectLinker to find and modify,\nbut no success:\n \nLoading C:\\Users\\moljac\\Desktop\\ProjectLinker\\ProjectLinker\\ProjectLinker\\ProjectLinker.csproj ...C:\\Users\\moljac\\Desktop\\ProjectLinker\\ProjectLinker\\ProjectLinker\\ProjectLinker.csproj : error  : The project file 'C:\\Users\\moljac\\Desktop\\ProjectLinker\\ProjectLinker\\ProjectLinker\\ProjectLinker.csproj' cannot be opened.  \n \nRunning VS2010...\nmel\n \nwww.holisticware.net \"\n \nmore information in this thread: http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/253508",
