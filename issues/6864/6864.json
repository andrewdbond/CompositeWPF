For additional support regarding this subject, you could create a thread in the discussions section, where we will help you with your concerns.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you can't use the self extractable download, you might also find the download in the Source Code section useful (http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAgustin Adami\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami",

If not, you will have issues as the self extractor launches a .vbs file to do the heavy lifting.\r\nHave you saved the file locally?  \r\nHave you unblocked the file? (in Windows Explorer: right click, properties, \"Unblock\".  This is because your OS is probably trying to protect you from yourself)\r\n",

Then unzip the source dir on our own. \r\n\r\nYou can also detach PKZip as your default for the .zip, run the .exe and then put it back. But I actually find the hack to be much faster. ",
