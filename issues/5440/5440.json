      "Message": "I cannot get the Prism assemblies to build using Unity 2.0.  I have been trying for two days.  The problem is that the IUnityContainer.AddNewExtension no longer exists.  There is a generic method that is gone.  And there is no mention of it in any of the Unity 2.0 documentation.  They did document plenty of the changes and deprecation on Unity 2.0, like the merge of ObjectBuilder2 into Unity and the deprecation of the Microsoft.Practices.ObjectBuilder2.BuildFailedException.  But there is no mention of the elimination of the AddNewExtension.  I pulled down the Unity 2.0 source code and confirmed the method is missing.  The Prism test projects use it extensively and they won't build along with the UnityBootstrapperExtension from the Composite.UnityExtensions.Desktop assembly.  I really need a Prism for Unity 2.0.  I have no choice but to keep trying to build it myself and the Unity 2.0 documentation has a hole in it.  What shall I do?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
