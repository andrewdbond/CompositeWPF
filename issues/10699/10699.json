    "Description": "I am trying to prototype a PRISM MEF application framework in order to restructure my project for usage\nwith PRISM but I cannot seem to get this to work with MEF:\n\n[https://edi.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=PRISM%20Unity%20versus%20MEF](https://edi.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=PRISM%20Unity%20versus%20MEF)\n\nMy problem is that I want to do something like *RegisterInstance* in *Unity* in **MEF**. Somehow I cannot determine why the ExportedValue<T>() call that I am using does not work for me? Can someone have a look at my prototype and tell me what I am doing wrong here?\n\nThanks Dirkster\n\n__Ah never mind I found my problem and have successfully resolved it. Please disregard this issue I am just not able to delete this item ...__",
