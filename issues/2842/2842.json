    "Description": "Hi, I'm new to CAL so I start playing with the Getting Started samples.\n \nI have play with ConfigurationModularity project and try to change the App.Config file to see what happen when I enter wrong info.\nSo, I have set the moduleType attribute of ModuleD to be \"ModuleD1.ModuleD\" insted of \"ModuleD.ModuleD\".\nThis cause a null reference exception in ModuleLoader class, line 87.\n \nThe problem there is that you try to create the type of the module, but fail to do so (since I enter type name which does not exists), but in the exception handling code you refer to variable name type which is still null!\nYou should only use moduleInfo because it is the only variable safe for access.\n \nIdo.",
