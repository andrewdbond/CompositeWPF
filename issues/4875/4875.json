    "Description": "Silverlight Navigation is a very interesting feature, however there is no support for it in Prism. Some people have tried to use navigation in Prism (see http://blogs.southworks.net/mconverti/2009/04/12/how-to-integrate-a-prism-v2-application-with-the-silverlight-3-navigation-framework/), but ran into several limitations. I would really like to see proper support for navigation in the next version of Prism.",
