    "Description": "I'm getting strange behavior with the ItemsControl in that the UserControl will stretch to fill a grid horizontally, but not vertically. \n \nIt seems others have encountered this problem as well:\nhttp://www.global-webnet.net/blogengine/post/2008/08/09/CompositeWPF-Getting-your-view-to-stretch-vertically-as-well-as-horizontally.aspx\nhttp://mrrask.wordpress.com/2009/06/17/composite-application-block-cab-itemscontrol-vertical-stretch/\n \nOne quick solution is to add a style to UserControl.Resources of Shell.xaml\n \n    <Style x:Key=\"ItemsControlLayoutFix\" TargetType=\"ItemsControl\">\n            <Setter Property=\"ItemsPanel\">\n                <Setter.Value>\n                    <ItemsPanelTemplate>\n                        <Grid/>\n                    </ItemsPanelTemplate>\n                </Setter.Value>\n            </Setter>\n    </Style>\n \nAnd then for your items control:\n \n   <ItemsControl Style=\"{StaticResource ItemsControlLayoutFix}\" Name=\"MyRegion\" Regions:RegionManager.RegionName=\"MyRegion\"/>\n \n             \n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nI have an example below that should reproduce this:\n \nWithin Shell.xaml's Layout root I add the following:\n \n    <Grid>\n                <Grid x:Name=\"First\" Background=\"Yellow\" IsHitTestVisible=\"False\">\n                        <TextBlock>Hi</TextBlock>\n               </Grid>\n                <ItemsControl Name=\"CaptionOptionsPopupRegion\" Regions:RegionManager.RegionName=\"CaptionOptionsPopupRegion\" />\n    </Grid>\n \nWithout ItemsControl this is just a Yellowscreen. Next, I create a Module \"TestModule\" and create a UserControl TestView.xaml, and I removed its Width and Height parameters from the UserControl element and then set its root as:\n \n    <Grid x:Name=\"LayoutRoot\" Background=\"#Blue\">\n                <TextBlock>Hi</TextBlock>\n    </Grid>\n \nSince \"LayoutRoot\" has the the same structure as the \"First\" grid, the Green should be overridden with Blue, since its layer is on top. However, What I end up with is a Screen filled with green with a single >row< of blue at the top of the page. Thus it seems like the HorizontalStretch is autofilling, but the VerticalStretch is not. I've tried setting VerticalAlignment/VerticalContentAlignment to stretch everywhere I could (including the ItemsControl), but the result is always the same.",

      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe've checked the scenario you're describing and found that the incorrect stretching scheme happens not only when using Prism Regions, but also when manually adding the UserControl to the ItemsControl's Items, therefore this doesn't seem to be a Prism issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback.\r\n\r\nGuido Leandro Maliandi\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi",
