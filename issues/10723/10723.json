    "Description": "I have a TabControl with a region. In the module's initializer I add 4 views to the region using RegionManager.RegisterViewWithRegion.\r\n\r\nIf I put a ViewSortHint on each of the 4 Views, sorting in the TabControl is as expected. If I omit the ViewSortHint for one view, this view is ordered ahead of the views having a ViewSortHint. This seems odd and to be in contradiction with the text at the bottom of page 143 of the guide where it reads \"Views that have the sort hint attribute are ordered ahead of those without.\".\r\n\r\nAm I doing a mistake or is there an error in this simple aspect of the Prism library?\r\n",
