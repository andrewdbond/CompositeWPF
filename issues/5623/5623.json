    "Description": "It'd be great if WeakEventHandlerManager was public, I've recently used it to make an CompositeConnected, similar to CompositeCommand but for an IConnected interface (for backend connectivity). Also for custom commands where DelegateCommand or CompositeCommand isn't suitable. I currently want to have a ConnectedDelegateCommand, its purpose would be to add some backend connection changed logic to a command.canexecute. Its proving hard as DelegateCommand<T>.canExecuteMethod is private, thus i need to derive (and cant access WeakEventHandlerManager).\nÂ \nGreat work on Prism, we love it :)",
