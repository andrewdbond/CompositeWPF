      "Message": "Hi Cortembert,\r\n\r\nI have tried to reproduce your issue, but the __ViewSwitchingNavigation Quickstart__ is working for me as expected. Nevertheless I would like to point out some points:\r\n\r\n* In order to run any ___Quickstart___ properly, you would need to previously build the __Prism Library.__ I am not sure if this would be the cause of your problem but it is good always to remind it.* When you download the __Prism__ source zip file, take into account that it may be _blocked_ and you would need to __Unblock__ for extracting. Otherwise, the extracted files could be corrupted.* Try to always extract files onto an empty directory, as file replacing could generate an undesired merge and leaving the source files also corrupted.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to download the source code again and using the above recommendations. If this is not helpful, I would appreciate if you further description for the error, together with possible correlative _errors/warnings_. \r\n\r\nRegards.Gabriel Ostrowskyhttps://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky",
