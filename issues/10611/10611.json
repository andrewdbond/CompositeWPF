      "Message": "Hi Johannes,\r\n\r\nBased on my understanding the _Click_ class has become deprecated on new techonologies. As Damian explains in the following thread, this class was available for use on App with __Silverlight__ versions that would not support _Command Bindings_ to Buttons:#* [prism:Click.Command & Property Binding](https://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/405813)\r\n\r\nTherefore, new techonologies that support _Command Bindings_ should not be using the _Click_ class. You can easily bind the _Command Property_ of a Button into the _Button Click_ handler. You may find an example of it on the __Commanding QuickStart__ at ___OrdersToolBar.xaml___:#* [Commanding QuickStart Using the Prism Library 5.0 for WPF](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921082(v=pandp.40).aspx)\r\n\r\nI hope this helped you,Regards.\r\n\r\nGabriel Ostrowskyhttps://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky",
