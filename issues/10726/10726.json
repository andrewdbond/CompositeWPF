    "Description": "We are using PRISM 4.1 and Unity. From what we read on Microsoft existing applications that target .NET 4.0 \"should just work\" as .NET 4.5.1 is an in place upgrade\r\n\r\nWe are running a Silverlight 5.0 OOB application w/RIA, PRISM 4.1 & unity that works fine on Windows server 2008 R2. When we try the same install on Windows Server 2012 R2 it doesn't seem to be able to load the component parts... I know Windows 2012 R2 uses .NET 4.5.1 but it's supposed to support .NET 4.0 applications. The company is not ready to do the work needed to upgrade everything to .NET 4.5.1.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if an existing prism 4.1 & unity application can run on Windows 2012 R2 without being upgraded.
