      "Message": "Hi Peter,\r\n\r\nI tried to reproduced the issue you mentioned above, but unfortunately I wasn't able to face it. The __TCP__ port you specify does not either appear from my side.\r\n\r\nBased on my understanding, the solution would only try to connect to Nuget site in order to install the PubSubEvent package. \r\n\r\nIt would be helpful for a deeper troubleshooting if you could tell us the __Visual Studio__ and __OS__ versions you would be working on. Also, I would appreciate if you could describe the repro steps you performed for building the __Prism__ Library.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, would your environment be configured with some internet custom settings?\r\n\r\nRegards.Gabriel Ostrowskyhttps://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky",
