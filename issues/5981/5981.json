    "Description": "Hello,\n \nI have CAL WPF client application which worked well with local database through ADO.Net Data Service WITHOUT any authentication feature enabled. But now I am suppose to work with Remote ADO.Net Data Service which needs Forms Authentication. I developed sample WPF application which worked fine. (referred : http://www.garrardkitchen.com/2009/09/forms-authentication-wpf/ )\n \nBut I am looking for the standard way to incorporate these into my CAL application. \n \nRegards,\nSmitha",

      "Message": "Hi Smitha,\r\nAs of the current version of Prism, there is no guidance on how to integrate composite applications with external data sources. However, you might find this thread useful, in which some possible approaches for doing so are explored:\r\nhttp://compositewpf.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=241013\r\nHope this helps.\r\n",
