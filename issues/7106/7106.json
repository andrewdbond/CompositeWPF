    "Description": "This information really needs to go in the Prism.chm file. New users are likely to go straight to the \"Getting Started\" section which tells them to run a batch file which opens a Visual Studio 2010 solution and the reader is told to build PRISM before they do anything else. When they immediately hit the Moq errors before even starting the \"Hello World\" quickstart that follows the initial impression given is not good.  If you tell them at this point that they will need to download Moq or remove the tests before attempting the build that will be more helpful than burying it in a .txt file somewhere else.",
