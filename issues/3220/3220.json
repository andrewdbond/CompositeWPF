    "Description": "This is a very small request. As they are, PRISM assemblies cannot be used by applications running in a partial trust security zone. For instance, my team is interested in using PRISM in an XBAP application (without full trust). Adding the following to Assembly.cs in PRISM projects does the trick: \n[assembly: AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers]\nÂ \nIs this desirable? Or do you have other suggestions? What is your opinion about using PRISM in XBAP applications (non-Silverligtht)?",
