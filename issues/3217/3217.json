    "Description": "We would like to sign the application and module assemblies. However, it is not possible at the moment given the fact that PRISM assemblies don't have a strong name. Of course, the workaround is to sign the assemblies ourselves which means rebuilding them. Are there any issues that I should be aware of regarding the signing of PRISM assemblies and distributing them in the field?",
