You can find more information about this in chapter 2 of the Prism documentation (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430868%28v=pandp.40%29#sec3):\r\n\r\n\"In a traditional Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application, a startup Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is specified in the App.xaml file that launches the main window. [...] In an application created with the Prism Library, it is the bootstrapper's responsibility to create the shell or the main window.\"\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDamian Cherubini\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini",

      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nUsually, this kind of behavior can occur if an \"StartupUri\" is present in the App.xaml file used by your application. Please remember that when creating a Prism application, the aforementioned property should not be present as the Shell window would be manually created in the Bootstrapper.\r\n\r\nIf this is not your case, it would be helpful if you could provide more information about your scenario or a repro-sample application so that we can help you further with this.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDamian Cherubini\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini",
