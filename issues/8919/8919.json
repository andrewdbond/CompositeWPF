      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nYou could try adding references to the custom SMF Player libraries in your shell project as well; that might be causing your problems when using it.\r\n\r\nOther than that, in my opinion Prism shouldn't be causing trouble when using a component such as the SMF player. If the aforementioned suggestion doesn't help you solve your problem, you could try placing your control directly in the shell; that could give us additional hints on why the problem is happening.\r\n\r\nI hope you find this helpful.\r\n\r\nGuido Leandro Maliandi\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi",

      "Message": "Hi Guido,\r\n\r\nThank you for your help and here is what I did and the result\r\n1. I did add references to SMF Player Libraries (the following files - Window 7) to shell project\r\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Microsoft Silverlight Media Framework\\v2.6\\Silverlight\\Bin\\Microsoft.SilverlightMediaFramework.Core.dll\r\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Microsoft Silverlight Media Framework\\v2.6\\Silverlight\\Bin\\Microsoft.SilverlightMediaFramework.Plugins.dll\r\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Microsoft Silverlight Media Framework\\v2.6\\Silverlight\\Bin\\Microsoft.SilverlightMediaFramework.Plugins.SmoothStreaming.dll\r\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Microsoft Silverlight Media Framework\\v2.6\\Silverlight\\Bin\\Microsoft.SilverlightMediaFramework.Utilities.dll\r\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\IIS Smooth Streaming Client\\v1.5\\Silverlight\\Microsoft.Web.Media.SmoothStreaming.dll\r\n\r\nI then rebuild and run it, the SMF player is shown but can't play. I press play button, nothing happen.\r\n\r\n2. I continue with the second options of your instruction, I then just add the SMF control directly to \"TopLeftRegion\" of the Shell as:\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n     \r\n             \r\n                \r\n                    \r\n                \r\n            \r\n     \r\n...\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI then re-compile and run it, the result is the same, SMF player is shown but can't play even pressing the play button.\r\n\r\nP/S: the shell project I created is an Prism Silverlight 4.0 Shell (Unity).\r\n\r\nI attached the result image also.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for looking into this Guido.",

The explicit different I see in your code is that you don't add SMFModule module into SMF.Web as an Application (Right Click into SMF.Web -> properties -> Silverlight Applications). Here you only have SMF not the SMFModule. While I do, I use the Prism Template to create both the Shell and then the SMFModule, then I have to add to SMF and SMFModule in the SMF.Web.\r\n\r\nDid you have my Silverlight example without modification working on yours?\r\nThanks",
