    "Description": "Hi,\n \nWhen running the StockTraderRI application (Prism-2008-03-12 release) the DI container apparently cannot resolve the PositionSummaryPresenter.  It throws an exception on \n \n            PositionSummaryPresenter presenter = _container.Resolve<PositionSummaryPresenter>();\n \nMessage:\nResolution of the dependency failed, type = \"PositionSummaryPresenter\", name = \"\". See the InnerException for more details.\n \nI tried to register PositionSummaryPresenter but that did not work.\n \nThanks for any help.",

Please find in attachment a screenshot of the PositionModuleInitializer with below it the results of a search for \".RegisterType\". As you can see, the view gets registered but the presenter does not. I tried to add \r\n\r\n            _container.RegisterType\r\n();\r\n\r\n(since I do not find an IPositionSummaryPresenter interface) but that does not resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJoris\r\n\r\n",
