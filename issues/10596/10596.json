    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI downloaded the Prism V5, built the library, and built the BasicMVVMQuickStart_Desktop solution. VS2013 output three compile errors, of which two are related to the ViewModelLocator as shown below:\n\n* The name \"ViewModelLocator\" does not exist in the namespace \"clr-namespace:Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Mvvm;assembly=Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Mvvm.Desktop\".\n* The property 'ViewModelLocator.AutoWireViewModel' does not exist in XML namespace 'clr-namespace:Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Mvvm;assembly=Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Mvvm.Desktop'.\n\nI searched the entire library source for \"ViewModelLocator\", but could not find it. Where could I find it?\n\nThanks,\n\nTetsu Shimizu",

Perhaps you downloaded the ___Beta___ version when it was not stable yet.\r\n\r\nI suggest you to download the source library again from the following site:#* [Prism 5.0 for WPF â€“ April 2014](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42537)\r\n\r\nI hope this helps,Regards.\r\n\r\nGabriel Ostrowskyhttps://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky",

Still, I'm expecting that Microsoft post the full V5.0 source code that includes the ViewModelLocator class on this site in near future.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nTetsu Shimizu",
