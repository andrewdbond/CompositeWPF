    "Description": "I have checked source code of [RegionNavigationService](https://compositewpf.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#V5/PrismLibrary/Desktop/Prism/Regions/RegionNavigationService.cs), and It seems there is no such mechanism. I think it would be a good idea to Dispose view/view model when IRegionMemberLifetime.KeepAlive is false. This is a good practice to put all clean ups in Dispose method such as unregistering static CompositeCommands or disposing DbContext instance in view model (yes, I'm not a fan of Repository pattern :P).",
