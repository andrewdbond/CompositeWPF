If it were, then this would be a different matter altogether. :)  You have to read the tea leaves here, but basically it appears that \"all power\" is being put into the relationship with Xamarin for XAML-based development.  Which is not a bad thing... Xamarin is pretty cool, and Xamarin.Forms is even cooler.  It's basically what MSFT should have announced at Mix 2011... you know, over 3 years ago. :P",
