    "Description": "In previous versions of Prism/CAL we were able to use locally built versions of Unity, Service Locator and CAL.  Looks like with the newer version of Prism we need to use a specific strong named version of Unity.  Even though we are using the supplied Unity 2.0 source code it looks like the service locator supplied with Prism is dependent on a specific version of Unity.  Our bootstrapper pukes when trying to resolve RegionBehaviorFactory(IServiceLocator serviceLocator) during construction of SelectorRegionAdapter.  I am not that familiar with signed assemblies besides why they are used.  Is there any way to remove this dependency?  To the best of my knowledge we are using the correct version of unity, but we are building it locally vs using the DLLs MS provides with their unity msi.\nÂ \nThanks for any responses.Dave Wendland",
