      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nFrom the section named \"Reducing the Download Size of Your Module XAP Files\" in the Deploying chapter of the Prism MSDN documentation (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430856%28PandP.40%29.aspx#sec3), \"(...) is to leverage application library caching in Silverlight. To use this feature, you go to the Silverlight project properties of a project and select the check box labeled Reduce XAP size by using application library caching. When you do this, any referenced assemblies that have the right metadata files collocated with them will not be included in the XAP file; instead, they will be placed in a separate .zip file, and the .zip file will be referenced by the XAP file's ApplicationManifest.xaml file as an external part. The signed Silverlight Prism Library binaries have the required metadata files to use this feature as well as the libraries from the Silverlight SDK and the Silverlight Toolkit. To leverage this functionality for your own shared assemblies, you need to provide a metadata file, as described in the topic, \"How to: Use Application Library Caching\" (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd833069(VS.95).aspx) on MSDN.\"\r\n\r\nI hope you find this helpful.\r\n\r\nGuido Leandro Maliandi\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi",
