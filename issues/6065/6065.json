If not, you will have issues as the self extractor launches a .vbs file to do the heavy lifting.\r\nHave you saved the file locally? \r\nHave you unblocked the file? (in Windows Explorer: right click, properties, \"Unblock\". This is because your OS is probably trying to protect you from yourself)",

      "Message": "This also occurs if you have PKZip as the default for your .zip files. \r\n\r\nWe have to run the exe till it gets to the point where it asks where to place the files, go to the temp dir where the Source.zip file has been extracted from the .exe,  copy that to another dir, cancel out of the exe.  Then unzip the source dir on our own.  \r\n\r\nYou can also detach PKZip as your default for the .zip, run the .exe and then put it back.  But I actually find the hack to be much faster.  \r\n",
