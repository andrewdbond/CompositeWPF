    "Description": "Here's a piece from RegisterMapping method:\n\t\t\tif (mappings.ContainsKey(controlType))\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t    throw new InvalidOperationException(String.Format(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture,\n\t\t\t                                                      Resources.MappingExistsException, controlType.Name));\n\t\t\t}\nIt can be read like this: if you already have a data type registered, you can't override the mapping by registering another mapping for the same control type. I understand that I can override ConfigureRegionAdapterMappings method in Bootstrapper (and I'm doing it anyways), but I can't call base class'es method if I want to override region adapter mapping. Is there any specific reason for not allowing to override region adapter mappings or is just to escape accidental confusion? If later is true, maybe adding parameter \"bool allowOverriding = false\" to method's signature is still a viable option (so that developer can intendedly go opt for this \"risk\")?",

      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback. This is something by design and the recommended approach to override a default mappings is just as you described. I think that it is expected that an application registers its mappings when the application starts up (bootstrapper) and avoid changing it afterwards to prevent any non expected behavior. \r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nFernando Antivero \r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero",
