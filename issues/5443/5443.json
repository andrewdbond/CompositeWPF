      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThank you for reporting this. Weâ€™ve verified the RemoveAll extension method in the ListExtensions.Silverlight.cs file and found that the current implementation could cause an undesired behavior. The Prism team has been notified of this and might include a fix on a future version.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMiguel Bronzovic\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic",
