    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI’m stomped on this one.  The Raised event of the InteractionRequest<T> is null the second time an interaction request is raised and hence doesn’t open the dialog.\n\nI managed to reproduce the issue in a simple example.  Check out the Menu in the MainWindow to see a working example, and one that doesn't:\n\n<Menu>\n            <MenuItem Header=\"RootMenuItem\">\n                <MenuItem Header=\"NotWorkingMenuItem\" Prism:RegionManager.RegionName=\"MenuRegion\"/>\n            </MenuItem>\n            <!--<MenuItem Header=\"WorkingMenuItem\" Prism:RegionManager.RegionName=\"MenuRegion\"/>-->\n        </Menu>\n\nHelp!!!  :)\n\nRené",

      "Message": "Hi Rene,\r\n\r\nI have troubleshoot your issue and it seems that the interaction request gets a null value because the ___AssociatedObject_Unloaded()___ method of __InteractionRequestTrigger__ class is being called twice after the popup is shown. This leads to setting null on both the ___sourceObject___ property and field which would not meet the validation for the next _Raise_ event.\r\n\r\nBased on my understanding, the addtional parent _MenuItem_ would be suscribing to the __InteractionRequestTrigger__ somehow and generating this behaviour of loading and unloading the event twice every time the _Request_ is _Raised_.\r\n\r\nI will continue troubleshooting this issue, and try to find a workaround in order to disable the parent _MenuItem_ effect.\r\n\r\nRegards.Gabriel Ostrowskyhttps://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky",
