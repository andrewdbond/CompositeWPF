    "Description": "It seems that the RegisterPrismLibrary.proj is not correct.\nAs 4.1 is supposed to be used for Silverlight 5. \nThe contents should be changed from\n \n    <RegistrationLine Include=\"[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Microsoft SDKs\\Silverlight\\v4.0\\AssemblyFoldersEx\\$(RegistrationKey)]\"/>\n \nto\n \n    <RegistrationLine Include=\"[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Microsoft SDKs\\Silverlight\\v5.0\\AssemblyFoldersEx\\$(RegistrationKey)]\"/>\n \n \nAnd when I did that on my computer (by doing a hard edit in the registry), things started to work properly again...\n \nJust for anyone out there who needed to know.\n \nMark,",
