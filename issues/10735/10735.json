    "Description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nWe have a view that opens a UserControl (UC1) as a popup using InteractionRequest<INotification>.\r\n         UC1ViewRequest.Raise(new UC1ViewModel\r\n        {\r\n            Title = \"User Control 1\"\r\n\r\n        });\r\n UC1 has a button that opens another UserControl (UC2) as a popup using InteractionRequest<INotification>.\r\n         UC2ViewRequest.Raise(new UC2ViewModel\r\n        {\r\n            Title = \"User Control 2\"\r\n\r\n        });\r\n Opening UC2 again and again from UC1 works fine as long as UC1 is not closed. \r\n\r\nBut after closing UC1, UC2 cannot be shown/opened from UC1 but UC1 can be opened again from the main view.\r\n \r\nThe Raised event on the UC2ViewRequest is null. \r\n\r\nPlease advise. Attached is the sample to reproduce.",
