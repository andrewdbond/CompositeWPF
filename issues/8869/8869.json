    "ClosedComment": "Hi,\r\n\r\nFor those interested in this topic, it might be helpful to know that since Prism 4.1 the type constraint for the CommandBehaviorBase<T> class has been changed to UIElement for WPF and Control for Silverlight. Therefore, we are closing this work item as this is no longer an issue in Prism.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is an existing work item already portraying this suggestion were you can find more information about this:\r\n - Change Constraint for CommandBehaviorBase for WPF (http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/workitem/4052)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDamian Cherubini\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini",
