    "Description": "The examples in Chapter 9 refer to non-existent code in the latest Stock Trader RI example.\nPerform a full Solution search on \"this.eventAggregator.GetEvent<TickerSymbolSelectedEvent>().Subscribe\"\nor\n\"_container.RegisterType<IMarketFeedService\"\nNothing is returned.\nThe latter text is supposed to be in the file \"MarketModule.cs.\" But in that actual file, you find this in the comments:\n\"This module is intentionally left empty because views, services, and other types are discovered through declarative attributes. View registration for this module is done through the ViewExportAttribute.\" \nÂ \nFor more information, you can check the following thread from the discussions: http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/250252",
