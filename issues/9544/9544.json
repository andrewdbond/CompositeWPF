    "Description": "After intalling and registering Prism 4.1 I've found that Prism dlls do not listed in \"Add Reference..\" list filtered by Silverlight 5.\nI've registered them by using GacUtil in MSVS 2010 SP1 command prompt:\ngacutil /i \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Prism v4.1\\Bin\\Silverlight\\Microsoft.Practices.Prism.dll\"\ngacutil /i \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Prism v4.1\\Bin\\Silverlight\\Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Interactivity.dll\"\n...\nand so forth.\nThere was message that dll registered successfully for each dll.\nHowever these dlls do not appears in \"Add Reference..\" list filtered by Silverlight 5.\nThen I'm trying to add Microsoft.Practices.Prism.dll in my fresh new SL5 project and getting error message that: \nError\t1\tCannot resolve reference assemblies. Please check the reference assemblies. Could not load file or assembly 'System.Windows, Version=5.0.5.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e' or one of its dependencies.
