    "Description": "The UnityBootstrapper ConfigureDefaultRegionBehaviors() method currently adds the AutoPopulateRegionBehavior as the first default behavior in the defaultRegionBehaviorTypesDictionary.\n \nFor a Silverlight application using View Discovery, attaching the AutoPopulateRegionBehavior to a region before the other default behaviors can cause the views registered against the region to be created and added to the region before other default behaviors are attached to the region. This can result in an ActiveAware view not being informed it is active since the ActiveAware behaviour hasn’t been attached to the region at the point where the view is created and added to the region.\n \nThe order the default behaviors are added needs to be reassessed to prevent scenarios like the one just described.",
