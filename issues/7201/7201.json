Since this is not a Prism Issue, I'm closing it. You might continue your inquires in the Silverlight forums (http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/).\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback.\r\n\r\nGuido Leandro Maliandi\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi",

    "Description": "I just downloaded Prism 2.2, and built the Prism Assemblies in a Release Build for x86 (as opposed to a Debug build for AnyCPU)\nThen started a new Silverlight Application using VS 2010.\nWithout making any changes I just run the app, to make sure all is well.\nThen I add references to the Silverlight Prism assemblies.\nThen I F5 run the app again.  This time I get a Webpage Error dialog from Internet Explorer saying:\nLine: 56\nError: Unhandled Error in Silverlight Application \nCode: 2105    \nCategory: InitializeError       \nMessage: Failed to load pre-requisites for the application     \nÂ \nWhat gives?  Any idea what I need to do to resolve this?\nThanks,\nShawn.\nPS, When I build the assemblies using the default Debug Build for AnyCPU, and reference these assemblies in my Silverlight app all is well.",
