    "Description": "This is related to #10718, but it would be nice to move the ILoggerFacade interface into the SharedInterfaces assembly.  That way it can be used outside of the context of the Prism core assemblies, and also beef up that rather bereft assembly, to boot.  Not very often you see a project with one class in it. :P",
