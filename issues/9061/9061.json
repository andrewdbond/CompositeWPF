But when I changed the project to Silverlight 5 \nI started getting the error\n\"Unable to load one or more of the requested types. Retrieve the LoaderExceptions property for more information.\"\n \nSo Does Prism does not support Silverlight 5 ?\n \nRegards",

      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nSo far we have we have smoke tested the Prism assets against Silverlight 5 and found that they seem to work properly.\r\nAs far as I now most of the problems reported regarding this were caused by referenced assemblies that weren't compiled against SL5.\r\n\r\nYou might find the following discussions useful as they could be related to your problem:\r\n\r\nSL5 InteractionRequestTrigger (http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/282474)\r\nDynamic Module Loading with MEF in SL5  (http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/282685)\r\nDoes Prism 4 support Silverlight 5 Beta? (http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/254403)\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if your scenario is not related to the ones described in the aforementioned discussions. If so it would be helpful if you could provide us with a repro sample application that  portrays this problem, so we can help you further whith this.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAgustin Adami\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami",
