      "Message": "Hi Jdang,\r\n\r\nThe behavior you're mentioning is that of a region defined in an ItemsControl; that is to say, a control that can host multiple items inside it. If you wish to obtain a behavior in which each views you add replace the former one, you should define your region inside a ContentControl. You can find more information about it in the UI Composition chapter of the Prism MSDN documentation (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921098%28PandP.40%29.aspx).\r\n\r\nIf you have further concerns about this, please create a discussion in the Prism discussion boards.\r\n\r\nI hope you find this helpful.\r\n\r\nGuido Leandro Maliandi\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi",
