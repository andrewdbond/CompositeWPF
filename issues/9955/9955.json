    "Description": "Hi Team,\n\nI found a bug (or may be something i am not aware) in Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Interactivity.dll. When you add this dll to your project, it disable intellesense in your xaml. so if you write something like xmlns:local=, and when you type = or press Ctrl+Space after equal, it does not show you any list. Even i tried and wait but never showed up. even if i manually type namespace and use classes, it throw compile time error that class not found in assembly. Please have a look into this. \n\nVikas Dangwal",
