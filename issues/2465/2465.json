The exception message is now:\r\n\r\n\"The IRegionAdapter for the type {0} is not registered in the region adapter mappings. You can register an IRegionAdapter for this control by overriding the ConfigureRegionAdapterMappings method in the bootstrapper.\"\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDamian Cherubini\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini",
