    "Description": "When downloading 'XAP A' with dependent module 'A1' on module 'B1' from 'XAP B' I found a race condition during A1 module initialization. Even if A1 has DependsOnModules attribute set to module B1, it happens when XAP A is downloaded and processed before XAP B download completed. In this case A1 just skip DependsOnModules in ModuleManger.AreDependenciesLoaded by checking currently loaded Modules in ModuleCatalog only.\n \nProposed fix:\nchange return value in Prism.Desktop\\Modularity\\ModuleManager.cs to consider DependsOn qunatity\nprivate bool AreDependenciesLoaded(ModuleInfo moduleInfo)\n        {\n            IEnumerable<ModuleInfo> requiredModules = this.moduleCatalog.GetDependentModules(moduleInfo);\n            if (requiredModules == null)\n            {\n                return true;\n            }\n \n            int notReadyRequiredModuleCount =\n                requiredModules.Count(requiredModule => requiredModule.State != ModuleState.Initialized);\n \n            // bug: it wasn't checking whether module depends on other not yet loaded modules in ModulesCatalog\n            return notReadyRequiredModuleCount == 0 && requiredModules.Count() >= moduleInfo.DependsOn.Count;\n        }",

      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI tried to reproduce the error you are mentioning, but without success. To do this, I created a sample application with two modules A and B (in different XAPs) registered through a Xaml file, where module A depends on module B. These modules are downloaded remotely at the same time, and module B size is larger than A, to ensure module A completes its download before its dependency. As expected, module A is not initialized until module B initializes, because of the dependency. You can find the sample in my skydrive account (https://skydrive.live.com/?ppud=4#!/?cid=7890102b5b8bc928&sc=documents&uc=1&id=7890102B5B8BC928!103), under the name remoteModuleLoadingWithProgress. \r\n\r\nPlease let us know if your scenario is different. If that’s the case, it would be helpful if you could provide us with a repro sample application that portrays your problem, so we can find the cause and a possible solution for your issue.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAgustin Adami\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami﻿",
