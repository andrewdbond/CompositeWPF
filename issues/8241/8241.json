    "Description": "EventAggregator should really be shorter than it is.\n \n- Remove the CompositePresentationEvent<TEvent> (What a name!?) - really only the POCO or even body-class (sealed and private ctor!) should be the event\n- Allow non-generic events and corresponding non-generic actions\n- Easier way to unsubscribe and dispose caller\n \nI would say a contract like this would be great.\nWould love to hear what other people think, and why they think different.\n \nThanks\n \npublic interface IEventAggregator\n{\n  void Publish<TEvent>();\n  void Publish<TEvent>(TEvent @event);\n  SubscriptionToken Subscribe<TEvent>(Action action, ThreadOption threadOption = ThreadOption.PublisherThread, bool keepSubscriberReferenceAlive = false);\n  SubscriptionToken Subscribe<TEvent>(Action<TEvent> action, ThreadOption threadOption = ThreadOption.PublisherThread, bool keepSubscriberReferenceAlive = false, Predicate<TEvent> filter = null);\n  void Unsubscribe(SubscriptionToken subscriptionToken);\n  void Unsubscribe<TEvent>(SubscriptionToken subscriptionToken);\n  void Unsubscribe<TEvent>(Action action);\n  void Unsubscribe<TEvent>(Action<TEvent> action);\n}\n \nMeanwhile, read this: http://neverindoubtnet.blogspot.com/2009/07/simplify-prism-event-aggregator.html",
