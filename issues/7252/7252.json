    "Description": "The ModuleInfoGroup does not implement int IList.Add(object value) properly.  In current implementaion the method always returns 1, but it is expected to return the index at which the item was added at.  It is expected to be added at the end of the list.  Changing the implementation to something like the following solves the issue.\nÂ \n    int IList.Add(object value)\n    {\n        int insertPos = this.Count;\n        this.Add((ModuleInfo)value);\n        return insertPos;\n    }",
