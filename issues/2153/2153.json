    "ClosedComment": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIt could be useful to know that, as of Prism v2.2, the behavior you've mentioned has been addressed.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this, here's a fragment of the RegisterViewsAndServices method, which is called from the PositionModule's Initialize method:\r\n\r\n _container.RegisterType<IOrdersController, OrdersController>(new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager());\r\n\r\nAs shown in the code above, the OrdersController interface mapping is done passing a ContainerControlledLifetimeManager, hence marking it as a Singleton instance.\r\n\r\nWe've also found that a similar fix was applied to the News Module.\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback.\r\n\r\nGuido Leandro Maliandi\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi",

    "Description": "In the current implementation (drop 05-02-2008), there are couple of references to the controller that may cause some nasty bug if it is not done intentionally.\nFor example\nIn PositionModule.Initialize(), the code try to resolve an IOrderController -> create new instance\nThen in PositionSummanyPresenter, we have IOrderController as a constructor parameter that will create another instance of OrderController when the code try to resolve IPositionSummaryPresenter",
