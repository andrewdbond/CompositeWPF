    "Description": "I would like to request the ability to stop\\restart the running instance of webdev.webserver40.exe listening on a specific port.\n \nFor example, whenever my unit test class's Setup fixture is run, the web server is started on a specific port (ex. 8080).\nHowever, I usually do not stop the development web server because if a unit test fails, I can usually still see the error on the screen and interact with the web server, etc. for diagnostic purposes without have to run webdev.webserver40.exe again.\nWhen I recompile my unit test and run it, the Setup fixture will try to run webdev.webserver40.exe again on the same port and will produce the message:\n---------------------------\nASP.NET Development Server\n---------------------------\nFailed to start ASP.NET Development Server on Port:8080\nError:Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted\n \n---------------------------\nOK   \n---------------------------\n \nI would like to be able to dynamically determine if webdev.webserver40.exe is listening on a specific port (and on a specific path) and stop\\restart it.\n \nThank you.",
