      "Message": "Hi Mohamed,\r\n\r\nSupport for Universal or Convergent Apps is in the Prism Roadmap as explained in [this post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/blaine/archive/2014/04/24/prism-5-0-for-wpf-just-released.aspx) and [this post](http://prismwindowsruntime.codeplex.com/discussions/541667). \r\n\r\nThe good news is that the p&p team already published a first drop with the progress being done on that area. You can find the drop under the [\"Converged\"](https://prismwindowsruntime.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#Converged/) folder in the source code tab of the [Prism for Windows Runtime](https://prismwindowsruntime.codeplex.com/com/) project.\r\n\r\nI hope you find this helpful.Thanks,Ez.http://blogs.southworks.net",
