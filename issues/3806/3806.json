    "Description": "I'm having to address long path problems due to the very long paths in the Prism V2 source.  Windows and our CM tool have issues with paths longer than 255 characters.  The worst-case file currently has the following path:\n \nQuickstarts\\UI Composition\\UIComposition.Tests.AcceptanceTest\\UIComposition.Tests.AcceptanceTest\\TestInfrastructure\\DataProvider\\ModuleDataProviders\\EmployeeDataProvider.cs\n \nThat's 173 characters, leaving only 81 characters for the parent folder hierarchy.  We are storing the source in a top-level structure in our CM that looks like this:\n \nMicrosoft\\Practices\\Composite\\CAL v2\\{CAL SOURCE}\n \nEven with this at the C: root, the file above has a path length of 212 characters.  Needless to say, most of our developers don't set their working folders at C:.  So, they only have 43 characters to play with for their own organizational scheme.\n \nPlease consider some strategy to keep the Prism source paths to a minimal length.\n \nThanks...",
