    "Description": "Hi\nI have decided to take a closer look at Prism. I am fairly new to both programing and Prism. Most of my experience thus far has been with VB.Net so I downloaded the Prism V4 VB only to find that all the .chm files in this download are in fact direct copies of the files from the Prism V4. Therefore all Hands-on labs and quick starts are in C#.\nThis is making following these hands-on and quick starts very confusing and difficult. \nAre there .chm files with the code examples written in visual basics available?\nÂ \nThank you for your help",

      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe've checked the content of the Visual Basic Prism 4 Reference Implementations, QuickStarts, and Hands-on Labs release (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=bd727f0f-a52d-4503-b006-a91c375b9241&displaylang=en). The QuickStarts and Reference Implementations there are coded in Visual Basic, and the API Reference CHM files contain information for both C# and Visual Basic.\r\n\r\nThe main CHM (Prism4.chm), however, only contains code snippets in C#, thus I'm leaving the work item open for the team to consider adding this on a future release.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nGuido Leandro Maliandi\r\nhttp://blogs.southwork.net/gmaliandi",
