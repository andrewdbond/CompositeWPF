    "Description": "Are ya'll going to be doing any WPF examples cause starting to get the impression that there isn't a drive towards WPF as much as you have pushed for Silverlight development.  Some of the MVVM practices you are starting to code into Prism is targeted directly at Silverlight, prime example is \"ChildWindow\",  I can't use that code example since the childwindow control doesn't exist in WPF, it strictly Silverlight.  Starting to concern me since I am primarily a WPF developer at present haven't made the jump into RIA development yet.",
