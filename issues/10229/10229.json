    "Description": "Hi,\nwe are struck in an issue while Binding the Textblock with a value and progressbar Value .\n\nwe have a wpf shell app , wherein we need to show a dialog which has  Textblock showing the %percentage,Progressbar ,Ok,Cancel etc .\nClicking on Button (ok} will start a DB call and once DB helper publishes this event , This dialog viewmodel subscribes it and assign the value returned from DBHelper to ViewModel.ProgressVale property , as well as ViewModel.PercentComplet property. The issue is The property has value and it is INotified as well. \nI am feeling the issue is with DataContext , We are using InteractionRequest to open the dialog and passing the Viewmodel. I guess the viewmodel is not updated or the DataContext is not refreshed.\nplease need urgent help to sort this issue out. let me know if my understanding is correct or I am missing anything .Thanks again\n\nKrishna",
