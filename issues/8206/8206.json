    "Description": "I create a project including some modules, and each module has a config.xml build action as \"Content\". So I can easily change the config but the code need not to be rebuild. However, I can not read the config in module as follows:\n \n            var stream = Application.GetResourceStream(new Uri(\"Config/Config.xml\", UriKind.RelativeOrAbsolute)).Stream;\n \nIt actually searches resource in shell not in module.",
