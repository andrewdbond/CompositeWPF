    "Description": "Will try the above and let you know.  just a suggestion, we are trying to promote prism to wider audience but doesn't give a positive first impression when the installation is not straight forward.  fyi, we work for a very large corporation and\n lot of corps like ours probably are using tools such as pkzip.   Wondering if you thought about either another alternative to current installation or changing it?  Thanks for the quick replies.",
