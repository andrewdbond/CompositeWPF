    "Description": "Hi, I have created a module with SMF player v2.7 as view and used with prism to show in a region. When I build the solution, the player is loading but it is not playing anything in there. Code for the player is as follows where mediasource is static. \n\n<smf:SMFPlayer>\n        <smf:SMFPlayer.Playlist>\n            <media:PlaylistItem DeliveryMethod=\"AdaptiveStreaming\" MediaSource=\"http://video3.smoothhd.com.edgesuite.net/ondemand/Big%20Buck%20Bunny%20Adaptive.ism/Manifest\"/>\n        </smf:SMFPlayer.Playlist>\n    </smf:SMFPlayer>\n\nPlease anyone help me fix this. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

Nevertheless, we could reproduce your issue when a reference from the following list is missing:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.SilverlightMediaFramework.Core.dll* Microsoft.SilverlightMediaFramework.Plugins.dll* Microsoft.SilverlightMediaFramework.Plugins.SmoothStreaming.dll* Microsoft.SilverlightMediaFramework.Utilities.dll* Microsoft.Web.Media.SmoothStreaming.dll\r\n\r\nAs a possible solution, check if you have these references added in both your module and your shell project.\r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\n\r\nFederico Martinez http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez",

It has a \"MainRegion\" in the __Shell__ and a decoupled __SMFModule__ (loaded through a __XAML ModuleCatalog__) that has the view containing the __SMF Player__. This view is injected in the aforementioned region at start up.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps,\r\n\r\nDamian Cherubinihttp://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini ",

Its worth mentioning that I am trying to add this player inside my existing silverlight 4 application but couldn't get it to work. Isn't that possible? Could you please walk me through brief steps how I can upgrade the player in an existing application?\r\n\r\nThanks,Sharath",
