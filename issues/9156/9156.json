    "Description": "Hi developers,\n \nI stumbled upon a possible bug while making use of the latest PRISM build (64970) in conjunction with the latest MEF 2.0 release (Preview 5). As far as I know, the upgraded MEF version should not matter for this bug, but I let you know for the sake of completeness.\n \nLine 122 of RegionActiveAwareBehavior.cs should be changed to\nif (regionManager != null && regionManager != this.Region.RegionManager)\n \nwhen this nullcheck is absent I receive a NullReferenceExpection in the following situations:\n \n(1) Register a view to a ContentControl region with regionManager.RegisterViewWithRegion(), then load another view into this region with regionManager.RequestNavigate()\n \n(2) Trying to register a view via regionManager.RegisterViewWithRegion() when the region is a TabControl\n \nHope this helps you to make PRISM even better.\n \nGood luck!",

      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe created a sample application to reproduce this issue but we were unable to do so.\r\n\r\nWe tried both scenarios you mentioned and found no exception. Are you using the SyncActiveState attribute in your solution? It would be helpful if you could provide us with a repro sample portraying the problem so we can examine it with further detail. As a side note, we agree with you that the upgraded MEF version shouldn't be related to this problem, so that factor needn't be included in your sample.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I believe your suggestion makes sense, the null check is probably needed so I think it should be added.\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing this out,\r\n\r\nGuido Leandro Maliandi\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi",

      "Message": "Hi GuidoMaliandi,\r\n\r\nCurrently i'm very busy to get things done, so i'm unable to present you with a nice testcase in which it goes wrong. I am willing to sent you my whole solution for you to debug, but not via this site as that would expose everything to the public which i don't want. Maybe I could sent it to you via email with some instructions on howto reproduce? As it is just a harmless null check I understand if you want to avoid the hassle and implement it anyway.\r\n\r\nThanks for your quick reply,\r\nLaurens",

In the source diff I see the check has now been implemented. Thank you for taking the time to fix this :-).\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nLaurens",
