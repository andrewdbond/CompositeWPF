    "Description": "Hi\nI have decided to take a closer look at Prism. I am fairly new to both programing and Prism. Most of my experience thus far has been with VB.Net so I downloaded the Prism V4 VB only to find that all the .chm files in this download are in fact direct copies of the files from the Prism V4. Therefore all Hands-on labs and quick starts are in C#.\nThis is making following these hands-on and quick starts very confusing and difficult. \nAre there .chm files with the code examples written in visual basics available?\nÂ \nThank you for your help",
