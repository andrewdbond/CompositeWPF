    "Description": "It would be useful to know the thinking behind some key decisions.  For example, why adopt MEF - I've had a look through the Discussions but can't find it.  My concern here is whether this is part of a gradual move from Unity 1 in Prism 2 to Unity2/MEF in Prism 4 no Unity at all in Prism 5 or 6 or whatever.  Perhaps the Home tab could have a page devoted to it?",

      "Message": "MEF was chosen for the StockTrader RI for teaching purposes.  We received feedback that customers needed guidance for using MEF in their projects.  We didn't want to have to maintain two sets of code (Unity & MEF) so we converted the code over to use MEF.\r\n\r\nPrism is container agnostic.  Meaning you can use any container you want.\r\n\r\nNo one should draw conclusions about Unity, just because it was not used in the StockTrader RI.\r\n\r\nOur Prism 4 documentation covers this question here:  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921140(v=PandP.40).aspx\r\n\r\nHave a great day,\r\n\r\nKarl",
