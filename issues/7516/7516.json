I realized that you posted this question at http://wp7guide.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=234471.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is official Prism forum, I would suggest you to follow this discussion over there, since a product team member is following your thread. \r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\nFernando Antivero\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\r\n",
