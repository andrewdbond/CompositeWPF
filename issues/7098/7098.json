    "Description": "In the new Prism 4.0 CTP why does Composite.Silverlight.Tests\\Mocks\\Modules\\createXap.bat try for Silverlight 2, then 3, then 4 rather than the other way around? I changed the file to reverse the order and it all worked fine! everything else seems to expect .Net 4 and Silverlight 4, so why not this?",

      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIt may be worth noting that, as explained in the associated discussion (http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/223153), this \"(...) should not impact since it is not possible to install two different version of Silverlight side by side\".\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm leaving this as an open suggestion so that the Prism team considers reviewing this for future versions.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAgustin Adami\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami",
