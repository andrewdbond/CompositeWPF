    "ClosedComment": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe are closing this work items, as this is not an issue in Prism, but a deliberated design decision: Prism is designed as a guidance with different patterns and capabilities that can be used individually or all together depending of the requirements of the scenario. For example, you might want to use the UI composition capabilities, or the navigation API provided by Prism using regions while you might not want to implement modularity in your application.\r\n\r\nIn this case, based on my understanding, the MVVM RI and Quickstarts were designed specifically to demonstrate the advantages of the MVVM pattern, rather than all the capabilities included in Prism.\r\n\r\nFor implementation examples of the MVVM pattern which includes other capabilities, such as regions, you might find useful other QuickStarts provided by Prism, such as the UI Composition QuickStart.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDamian Cherubini\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini",

    "Description": "Hello,\n \nI found it interesting that the MVVM RI (along with the MVVM quickstarts) doesn't use the Prism library at all: no modules, service locator, region management or event aggregator, and thus no bootstrapper. It uses its own solution for region management of a single region. It also doesn't make use of the Silverlight-specific CompositionInitializer pattern in Silverlight MEF.\n \nIs this the result of a deliberate decision?\n \nAlso, out of curiousity - StateManager and ViewFactory in the MVVM RI are app-wide services that use the MEF container. ViewFactory specifically calls out that one of the primary reasons it exists is to avoid composing the container in itself. Is composing an MEF container inside itself considered something of an MEF anti-pattern?\n \nNW",
