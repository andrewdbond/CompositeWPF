    "Description": "When installing the Prism.Source I get a ' the file name you specified is not valid or too long'. I narrowed down the issue to the path of a single file:\nD:\\Documents and Settings\\Siderite.SIFOR\\My Documents\\Visual Studio 2008\\Projects\\Prism\\Quickstarts\\UI Composition\\UIComposition.Tests.AcceptanceTest\\UIComposition.Tests.AcceptanceTest\\TestInfrastructure\\DataProvider\\ModuleDataProviders\\EmployeeDataProvider.cs\nwhich is longer than the MAX_PATH constant for Windows XP (260 characters) and results in all kinds of issues.\nÂ \nI've solved the issue by renaming the file to something smaller, but I think the issue lies with the folder structure.",
