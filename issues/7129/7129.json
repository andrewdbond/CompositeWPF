    "ClosedComment": "Hi,\r\nIt could be helpful to know that, as of the current release of Prism v4, the MefBootstrapper .RegisterBootstrapperProvidedTypes method (which gets called by the MefBootstrapper.ConfigureContainer method) no longer registers an additional instance of the Region Manager, leaving only one instance exported, which is the one exported by the MefRegionManager class.\r\nThank you for your feedback.\r\n",
