    "Description": "When I change startupLoaded=\"false\" to InitializeMode=\"OnDemand\" in the config file I receive the following error:\n \nUnrecognized attribute 'InitializeMode'. Note that attribute names are case-sensitive.\n \nI tried this in the ConfigurationModularity Quickstart and it fails there are well.  It would seem that this attribute has not been implemented yet however the documentation lists this change in the upgrading from June 2008 instructions.  Can you confirm this is the case?  Is there an expected date for this to be included?\n \nThank you.\nDave",

The product team is now aware of this and might tackle the issue in future releases.\r\n \r\nNote that, as of Prism v2 (and still present in Prism v4), the ModuleAttribute class (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.practices.composite.modularity.moduleattribute.aspx) has the StartupLoaded property deprecated in favor of an OnDemand one.\r\n \r\nThank you for your feedback.\r\n\r\nGuido Leandro Maliandi\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi",

      "Message": "Hi Alex,\r\n\r\nAs a possible approach to specify that you wish to load an specific module on demand in a configuration file, you can use the __startupLoaded__ attribute instead of the __InitializeMode__ attribute. An example of this can be seen in the __Modularity Quickstart for Desktop__ :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this helps,\r\n\r\nDamian Cherubinihttp://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini",
