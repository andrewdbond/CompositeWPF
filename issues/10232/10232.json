    "Description": "Turns out PRISM won't load modules correctly from a folder that contains a pound character in the name. I was experiencing a crash error like the following:\n\n>Failed to load type for module _MyModuleClass_. \n\n>If this error occurred when using MEF in a Silverlight application, please ensure that the CopyLocal property of the reference to the MefExtensions assembly is set to true in the main application/shell and false in all other assemblies. \n\n>Error was: Unable to locate the module with type '_MyModuleNameSpace.MyModuleClass_, _MyModuleAssembly_, Version=2.0.2.3361, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=nullamong the exported modules. Make sure the module name in the module catalog matches that specified on ModuleExportAttribute for the module type.\n\n\nUntil I realized my project was placed in a folder with a pound character, like _C:\\Whatever\\\\#Whatever\\MySolutionHere_\n\nAfter renaming the _#Whatever_ folder to _Whatever_ without the pound character, my modules were loaded again without issues and everything worked fine again.\n\nI am using Visual Studio 2012 Update 3 and my solution is a Prism WPF + MEF Shell application with all modules being loaded from the application folder. This is the configuration in the bootstrapper:\n\n```\nprotected override IModuleCatalog CreateModuleCatalog()\n{\n    // When using MEF, the existing Prism ModuleCatalog is still the place to configure modules via configuration files.\n    return new DirectoryModuleCatalog() { ModulePath = @\".\\\" };\n}\n```",
