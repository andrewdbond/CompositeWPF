    "Description": "Hi,\n \nI have defined TabItem as Region in my Shell and modules loaded will place their views into this region using MVVM Pattern. It seems to be working fine and I was able to set the Header of my TabControl from the Model assigned to it. Now I want the Image also to be loaded as part of the Tab Item Header. i.e. If I load search view , I want the TabItem Header to be like \"Search {Search Image}\". I was able to get this behavior in normal WPF application, but in CAL it does not seems to work. \n \nShell.xaml\n// Tab Item defined as the Region with setting its Header property to be HeaderInfo field of DataContext assigned.\n// This code works. But I want image also to be part of the Header...\n <TabControl AutomationProperties.AutomationId=\"SearchTabControl\"  \n                     x:Name=\"tbControl\" Style=\"{DynamicResource TabControlStyle}\" \n                      cal:RegionManager.RegionName=\"MainRegion\" >\n           <TabControl.ItemContainerStyle>\n             <Style TargetType=\"{x:Type TabItem}\">\n                <!--<Setter Property=\"HeaderTemplate\"> // This does not work in CAB...But it had worked in normal WPF application...\n                     <Setter.Value>\n                        <DataTemplate>\n                           <TextBlock Text=\"{Binding Content.DataContext.HeaderInfo}\"> </TextBlock>\n                        </DataTemplate>\n                      </Setter.Value>\n                    </Setter>-->\n                   <Setter Property=\"Header\" Value=\"{Binding Content.DataContext.HeaderInfo}\" /> // This works....But how to have image now...???\n             </Style>\n           </TabControl.ItemContainerStyle>\n        </TabControl>\n \n \n// Model which is assigned to TabControl....\npublic class SearchViewModel\n    {\n        public string HeaderInfo\n        {\n            get { return \"Search\"; }\n        }\n \n        // Image.....????\n      \n    }\n \n \nCan any one help me in this..?\n \nRegards,\nSmitha",
