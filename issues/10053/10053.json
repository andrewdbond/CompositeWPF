      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nBased on my understanding, in order to be able to load modules from the GAC using the configuration file, you need to:#+ Register all your module dll's into GAC+ Add references to these modules dll's into your working project+ Configure the app.config file accordingly \r\n\r\nAccording to your scenario, I believe you are facing problems with the app.config file. Therefore, here is a sample of how your app.config file should look like:\r\n\r\n```XML                            ```\r\n\r\nTake into account that is mandatory to specify the PublicKeyToken of your assembly to avoid further errors.\r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\n\r\nFederico Martinez http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez",
