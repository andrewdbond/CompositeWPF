It might be worth mentioning that the BasicMVVMApp QuickStart is only made in Silverlight, so that's the reason you have to install the Silverlight developer runtime.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this work item as this is not an issue in Prism.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGuido Leandro Maliandi\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi",

      "Message": "Found a solution to my problem:\r\n\r\n- Open the solution with Visual Web Developer 2010 (Express in my case)\r\n- Install Silverlight for developer\r\n\r\nSince I'm only interested in WPF, I didn't expect I would have to use Visual Web Developer at all. Ideally WPF only programmers shouldn't have to install silverlight, it's a bit Trojan Horsy. Visual Studio could also figure out on its own how to open the solution, it has all the information in the project files...\r\n\r\nBut it's all free, which softens that issue substantially :) Hope this helps other people that encountered the same issue.",
