      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nBased on my understanding this error is caused because in WPF, windows cannot be reopened after they are closed. As you may find this behavior can be reproduced in any WPF application. Hence, I believe you could find more information regarding this topic for example in the WPF forums (http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/wpf/threads/). \r\n\r\nFor example you could find the following related threads interesting:\r\n\r\n-Reopen a window in WPF http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/wpf/thread/85faaad1-a092-4bfe-b934-2d0ae917b654\r\n\r\n-WPF MVVM Application-->Exception Occurs http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wpf/thread/09e1cc8a-afeb-4201-b2d9-40b88549df22\r\n\r\n-Cannot set Visibility or call Show or ShowDialog after window has closed. http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/wpf/thread/868a5920-8712-47ee-b1af-e4058f583c0a\r\n\r\nI hope you find this handy,\r\n\r\nAgustin Adamihttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami",
