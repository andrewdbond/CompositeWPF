    "Description": "Hi there,\nI tried to deploy a simple CAL-Application inside of Visual Studio 2010 Beta 1 using ClickOnce. After deployment and succesful starting the program I tried to compile my application again. Now the following error occurs:\n \nResolution of the dependency failed, type = \"Microsoft.Practices.ServiceLocation.IServiceLocator\", name = \"\". Exception message is: The current build operation (build key Build Key[Microsoft.Practices.Composite.UnityExtensions.UnityServiceLocatorAdapter, null]) failed: ReadOnlyPermissionSet objects may not be modified. (Strategy type BuildPlanStrategy, index 3)\n \nI tried with another CAL-Application and got the same error after . Any ideas? Maybe it's because of Visual Studio 2010 Beta 1 ?!\n \nCheers,\n Joe",

We've deployed the HelloWorld QuickStart with ClickOnce and found no issues whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback.\r\n\r\nGuido Leandro Maliandi\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi",
