    "Description": "Right now one can only use\n<strong>void OnCommandExecuted(...) </strong>\nwhich would be nice to change to\n<strong>async Task OnCommandExecuted()</strong>\nÂ \nOne way this could be done to modify the ctor of DelegateCommand to accept Funct<Task,T> paramter which would then be awaited by delegate command execute implementation.",
