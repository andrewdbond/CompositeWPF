    "Description": "Attempting to use the UnityBootstrapper, but 'ConfigureContainer()' fails when calling the base.ConfigureContainer(), with a TypeLoadException when trying to load Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Regions.IRegionNavigationContentLoader.\nÂ \nIf I view Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Regions in the ObjectBrowser, I see IRegionNavigationContentLoader (as I should).  But, IRegsionNavigationContentLoader is not displayed in the intelliisense context menu when viewing the types in the Regions namespace.  For that matter, neither is RegionNavigationContentLoader.  Where did it go? Has anyone else encountered this?",
