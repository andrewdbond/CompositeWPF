    "Description": "Found in V2 Drop 9:\n \nOn my machine, I'm able to build the Debug configuration with no problems.  However, when trying to build the Release config, the Silverlight Test project throws this error:\n \nWarning\t1\tThe file 'Mocks\\Modules\\RemoteModules.xap' could not be added to the project.  Cannot add a link to the file C:\\data\\src\\PCWorkstation-svn\\WelchAllyn\\PDK\\Microsoft\\Practices\\Composite\\CAL v2\\CAL\\Silverlight\\Composite.Tests\\Mocks\\Modules\\RemoteModules.xap. This file is within the project directory tree.\tComposite.Silverlight.Tests\n \nI'm not sure what this means, but it is a build issue I'm seeing.",

It could be helpful to know that, as of Prism v4, there is no longer a warning for this.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you might find this thread (http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/55646?ProjectName=compositewpf) handy, where a similar behavior is explained.\r\n\r\nThank you for reporting this.\r\n\r\nGuido Leandro Maliandi\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi",
