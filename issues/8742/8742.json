    "Description": "The released Entlib 5 SL integration pack (we use the caching block in SL) uses unity 2.1 SL assemblies, that does not match the assemblies distributed with prism 4 / SL (see http://entlib.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=EntLib5Silverlight&referringTitle=Home )\nWe cannot resolve that issue without recompile / sigh the prism SL dlls by ourself, that is not the way we like to go.\nWill there be a refreshed release drop that resolve that?",
