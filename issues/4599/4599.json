      "Message": "I just dug into what is causing the problem and it is a flaw in Silverlight 3 unfortunately. SL 2 worked correctly as the UpdateHeaderVisuals correctly set the template by loading the content:\r\n\r\nContentControl contentControl = this.GetContentControl(this.IsSelected, this.TabStripPlacement);\r\n    if (contentControl != null)\r\n    {\r\n        if (this.HeaderTemplate == null)\r\n        {\r\n            contentControl.Content = this.Header;\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            FrameworkElement element = this.HeaderTemplate.LoadContent() as FrameworkElement;\r\n            contentControl.Content = element;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSL3 just sets the ContentTemplate of the header control to the HeaderTemplate which I don't think performs the data binding.\r\n\r\nI verified this by manually loading the TabItem.Header with the evaluation of its HeaderTemplate.LoadContent(). Probably the best way to workaround this problem is to create your own derived TabItem control to correct the problem by adding an additional step to the ApplyTemplate AND copy the TabControlRegionAdaptor to use your new derived TabItem control.\r\n\r\nI have not tested this yet but will post something when I have it working.",

      "Message": "I have another workaround until this is fixed properly - \r\n\r\nIn the TabControlRegionAdapter PrepareContainerForItem method, I inserted the line Fred showed above into the method, after the container.Style was set. So after the line:\r\n\r\ncontainer.Style = GetItemContainerStyle(parent); \r\nI added:\r\ncontainer.Header =  container.HeaderTemplate.LoadContent();\r\n\r\nThis performs the databinding and will set the headers from the binding on the presenter...\r\n\r\nIts a hack, but it will work until the right answer is posted...",
