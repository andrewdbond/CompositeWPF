    "Description": "Having cloned the repository, it presents itself as ReadOnly. Having remove that constraint I discover that the folders are a bunch of shortcuts that trigger a copy of visual studio to load, ostensible with the associated projects/solution.\r\n\r\nObviously somebody let a bored co-op student setup this project. \r\n\r\n1) I should not have to grant elevated privileged to a sample. It is security policy risk.\r\n2) Non-standard project layout is stupid. Why not write it in a new language so that in exploring your sample I also get to learn a new language.\r\n3) The expected value contributed by this sample represents a minuscule portion of my solution and should not occupy a great deal of time. If the solution is presented well, 10,000 people will spend 5 minutes (=50,000 minutes) and be happy. If it is poorly presented, 500 people will spend 20 (=10,000) minutes and be sad. Try and help the most people. You will be rewarded with popularity.\r\n\r\n",
