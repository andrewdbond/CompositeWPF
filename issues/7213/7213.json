    "Description": "Hi,\n \nI'm struggling with a DelegateCommand that is not activating a button that is situated in a different region. Example:\n \nHomeTab module: I have a HomeTab module with a region for adding buttons (using Fluent ribbon) relative to the active application.\nApplication module: I create a button view and view model and add the button to the region exposed in the HomeTab module. The button's has a DelegateCommand declared in the application module. However the button in the HomeTab region is never activating when it should be.\n \nI tested that CanExecute was working correctly by also binding a button in the current module to the same command and it worked fine.\n \nSo the problem only occurs when the button is situated in a different region. Is this a limitation / known issue? Or am I doing something wrong.\n \nThanks in advance,\n \nIan",
