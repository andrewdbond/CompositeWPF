    "Description": "Hi.\n \nThank you for Prism v4.0.\n \nI would like to request that AcceptanceTestLibrary\\Common\\Launcher\\Silverlight\\BrowserLauncherBase.cs is enhanced to to get the browser process using other options (like mentioned as a todo item in the code).\n \nI have found that if a run a test where the application title changes, then a call to \"SilverlightAppLauncher.UnloadBrowser(APP_TITLE);\" does not work as expected, where APP_TITLE was initially used in FixtureBase.LaunchApplication to get the browser process when it was first launched.\n \nThere are numerous work-arounds, but none are very elegant.\n \nDoes anyone know of a viable solution?\n \nThank you.",
