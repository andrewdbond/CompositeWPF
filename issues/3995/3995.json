    "Description": "I am using the Prism example as supplied to do some testing. I attempted to create a new dependency property class but found out quickly Unity is unable to resolve the DependencyObject. I see the shell is really a DependencyObject container, but an attempt to create a DependencyObject / DependencyProperty for example to bind to a TextBox results in the unity container not being able to resolve and load the shell or the presentation layers. Comment out the dependency property and it works fine. It is ok with normal properties and INotifyPropertyChanged.\nÂ \nIdeas appreciated.\nGlenn",

      "Message": "Hi Glenn,\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if you could provide us with further details on the scenario in which you intended to use Unity to resolve a DependencyProperty, or also a code sample to show where it is failing, so that we can help you determine where is the cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nAlso, as this is not strictly related to Prism, you might get better support in the Unity forums.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nGuido Leandro Maliandi\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi",
