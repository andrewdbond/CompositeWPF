    "Description": "Usually when the end user requires a multi-monitor application, it would be necessary to create multiple shell windows. \n \nnamespace HelloWorldSample\n{\n    internal class Bootstrapper : UnityBootstrapper\n    {\n        protected override IModuleEnumerator GetModuleEnumerator()\n        {\n            return new StaticModuleEnumerator()\n                .AddModule(typeof(HelloWorldModule));\n        }\n \n        protected override DependencyObject CreateShell()\n        {\n            Shell shell = new Shell();\n            shell.Show();\n \n            return shell;\n        }\n    }\n}\n \nThe CreateShell() does not allow the creation of multiple shells. It would be ideal to have a method like this one:\n \n protected override DependencyObject[] CreateShells()\n        {\n            var shell1 = new Shell1();\n            shell1.Show();\n \n     var shell2 = new Shell2();\n            shell2.Show();\n \n            return new []{shell1, shell2};\n        }\n \nAre you planning to add this functionality any time soon?\n \nThanks guys! Great job on PRISM V2 D2!",
