    "Description": "I wanted to throw out a request for consideration, namely breaking out common functionality in the Prism assembly that can be used in other hosted application contexts (such as WCF-Hosted or Windows Services Applications) that are not presentation-specific.\n \nThis assembly (perhaps named \"Prism.Core\") would host all the non-WPF-specific functionality, such as:\n \n- Events \n- Modularity \n- Logging \n- Other? \n \nThere's a lot of great functionality in these namespaces.  Applications should be able to leverage this functionality in other application contexts without having to reference WPF-specific libraries.",
