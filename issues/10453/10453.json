      "Message": "Hi Morrigan, \r\n\r\nWe would appreciate if you could describe some details of the exception you are facing. This way we could have a better understanding on the context specifications and we would be able to provide you a better response on this issue. \r\n\r\nWhen does this exception appear? We would like to know which executed feature would be throwing the exception.\r\n\r\nRegards.Gabriel Ostrowskyhttps://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky",

      "Message": "Windows Store applications work fine, its just Prism that throws an exception. I'm using Visual Studio 2013 with .Net 4.51 and Windows 8.1 which I suspect is the problem. The error appears to get thrown in App.xaml.cs by:```public static MobileServiceClient MobileService = new MobileServiceClient(                    \"https://pathfinder.azure-mobile.net/\",\"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"    );```![Image](http://example.com/logo.jpg)\r\n\r\n ",

      "Message": "Hi,\r\n\r\nBased on your description it seems you are using the __Prism for Windows Runtime__ version. If that is the case, this site is for the __WPF / Silverlight__ version of Prism only. The correct site to post this problem is:* [Prism for Windows Runtime forums on CodePlex](http://prismwindowsruntime.codeplex.com/discussions)\r\n\r\nIf that is not the case and you are developing a WPF application, then take into account that __.Net 4.5.1__ and __Windows 8.1__ are not officially supported in this version and might not work correctly.\r\n\r\nRegarding the exception you are mentioning, the image shows only a __Windows Azure's Mobile Services__ exception. It would be useful if you could provide more detail on this exception like the inner exception's details of where the exception is being thrown (in the corresponding forums.)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDamian Cherubinihttp://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini",
