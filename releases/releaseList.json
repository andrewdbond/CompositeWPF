Visual Studio exposes most of the capabilities needed for ClickOnce publishing. However, Visual Studio may not be available or desired for IT administrators who manage ClickOnce deployments on the server. Mage is designed to address most common administrative tasks for ClickOnce; it is a lightweight .NET Framework Windows-based application that can be given to your administrators. However, Mage requires many very detailed steps, performed in the correct order, for common tasks such as modifying the application files listed in the application manifest. \n\nTo make these tasks simpler, a custom utility is needed. \n\nThe *Manifest Manager Utility* sample utility here demonstrates how to use the ClickOnce publishing API to manage deployment and application manifests in a simpler way. This utility is used for updating application manifest file lists and deployment manifest settings in automated procedures for the How-to topics of the Composite Application Library.",

Overview\nPrism provides guidance designed to help you more easily design and build rich, flexible, and easy-to-maintain Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) desktop applications, Silverlight Rich Internet Applications (RIAs), and Windows Phone 7 applications. Using design patterns that embody important architectural design principles, such as separation of concerns and loose coupling, Prism helps you to design and build applications using loosely coupled components that can evolve independently but that can be easily and seamlessly integrated into the overall application. These types of applications are known as composite applications.\n\nPrism includes reference implementations, QuickStarts, reusable library code (the Prism Library), and extensive documentation. This version of Prism targets the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 and Silverlight 4 and includes new guidance around the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, navigation, and the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF). Because Prism is built on the .NET Framework 4.0 (which includes WPF) and Silverlight 4, familiarity with these technologies is useful for evaluating and adopting Prism.\n\n!!! Prerequisites\n* Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Professional, Premium, or Ultimate edition \n* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 (installed with Visual Studio 2010) \n* Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio 2010 (required for Silverlight development; includes the developer Silverlight runtime) \n* Optional tools:\n** Expression Blend 4\n** Windows Phone Developer Tools SDK (for development with the Windows Phone 7)\n\n!!!
