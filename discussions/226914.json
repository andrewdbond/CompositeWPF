I've even worked up an&nbsp;idea&nbsp;with Typemock Isolator, there is just to much trouble to set it up at the beginning at each test it will make your test look very complicated.</p>\r\n<p>So in the end I've settled at the MockUnityContainer implementation in the StockTrader reference implementation. Did some&nbsp;enchantments&nbsp;to support some of my scenarios and it works great.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This was my solution, if you do come with a better done do let us know.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>",
