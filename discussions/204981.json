Same way when user click on a button in a user control which in turn open a popup &amp; user adds some record in that window. When user closes that window the new record should be reflected in the launching window.</p>\r\n<p>I am looking for a loosly coupled communication. I am not sure whether Prism is the right framework, could you please point me to some sample which has same requirement as mine. In-case Prism is not the right framework, can anyone suggest me which is right pattern for this.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",
