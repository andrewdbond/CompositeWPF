    "Html": "<p>Hi Eran,</p>\r\n<p>Adding views to regions implies an additional overhead of creating the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.practices.prism.regions.itemmetadata%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">ItemMetadata </a>object and adding it to the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.practices.prism.regions.viewscollection%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">ViewsCollection</a> of the region, setting the <strong>RegionManager </strong>attached property, and so forth. Also, by using regions you are using the ItemsControl's <strong>ItemsSource </strong>property, and when you add the views to the ItemsControl's <strong>Items</strong> property, which are different approaches that might have different performance implications.</p>\r\n<p>However, based on my personal understanding of the scenario you're mentioning, it shouldn't take ~480ms to add a view into a region. It would be helpful if you could provide us with more information about the way you are adding the views to the region (e.g. if you're using DependencyInjection to obtain the views, if you're using scoped regions, etc).</p>\r\n<p>If you consider this to be blocking, you could create a work item in the <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/workitem/list/advanced\">issue tracker</a>, notifying the product team of this.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
