    "Html": "<p>Hi Truyenle,</p>\r\n<p>If I understood you scenario correctly, a possible approach could be to implement a shared service. This service could:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Contain a reference to <strong>Object A</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>Define an event (lets call it <strong>Event A</strong>), which could be raised when <strong>Object A</strong> is set/changed.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Following this approach, if <strong>XEventHandler </strong>is called, it should create <strong>Object A</strong> and set it in the shared service.</p>\r\n<p>If <strong>YEventHandler </strong>is called, then it could check if <strong>Object A</strong> was set inside the shared service. If so, then the <strong>Object A</strong> is retrieved and the <strong>YEventHadler </strong>is executed correctly. If <strong>Object A</strong> was not set, then you could subscribe to <strong>Event A</strong> (which will be raised when <strong>Object A</strong> is set in the shared service) using another event handler or the same <strong>YEventHadler</strong> and return. When <strong>Event A</strong> is raised, you can retrieve <strong>Object A</strong> from the service and execute the corresponding logic in <strong>Module C</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>However, as this is not strictly related to Prism, I believe you would find better support in the C# forums:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/category/visualcsharp\">Visual C# Forums on MSDN</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
