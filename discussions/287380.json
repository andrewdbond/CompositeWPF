As a possible approach to achieve the scenario you are mentioning, I believe you could use <strong>KeyBindings </strong>in your view/s to invoke a command in the corresponding view model.</p>\r\n<p>You can find more information about <strong>KeyBinding </strong>in the following article in MSDN:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.input.keybinding.aspx\">KeyBinding Class in MSDN</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
