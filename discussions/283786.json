    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>The Prism Library provides different approaches for communicating between modules. Which one you choose may depend on your particular scenario:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Solution commanding:</strong> Use this when there is an expectation of immediate action from the user interaction. </li>\n<li><strong>Region context: </strong>Use this to provide contextual information between the host and views in the host's region. This approach is somewhat similar to the DataContext, but it does not rely on it. </li>\n<li><strong>Shared services:</strong> Callers can call a method on the service which raises an event to the receiver of the message. Use this if none of the preceding is applicable. </li>\n<li><strong>Event aggregation:</strong> For communication across view models, presenters, or controllers when there is not a direct action-reaction expectation.﻿ </li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might find more information about the aforementioned approaches in the Prism Documentation at MSDN:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921122%28v=PandP.40%29.aspx\">Chapter 9: Communicating Between Loosely Coupled Components</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope you find this helpful,</p>\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a>﻿</p>",
