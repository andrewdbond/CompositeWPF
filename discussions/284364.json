You can find different interaction patterns in the following chapter of the Prism documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405494%28PandP.40%29.aspx#sec10\">Chapter 6: Advanced MVVM Scenarios - User Interaction Patterns</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Which of the patterns described in the aforementioned link would be the appropriate in your case will depend mostly on your personal preferences and the requirements of your scenario.</p>\r\n<p>If you need any more assistance regarding this, it would be helpful if you could provide us with more information about what you are trying to achieve, so that we could help you further with it.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,<br /> <br /> Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
