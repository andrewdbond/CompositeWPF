Once run if the window is closed, and after that the project is compiled again it throws an error 'cannot copy to output folder' - one or the other dll and sometimes the shell.exe itself. I understand shell is leaving a process behind that i can see in the task manager also, once i kill that the project builds and executes again. How do I kill this shell process/how do I resolve this.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks<br>km</p>",
