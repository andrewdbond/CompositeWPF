However, I have tried to reproduce your issue with no success. I have uploaded the code I used <a href=\"http://cid-09f63fc7ac065e5e.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/p^0p Samples/RemovingViewsSample.zip\">here</a>. Check it out and let me know what are the differences with your scenario so I can try to reproduce it.</p>\r\n<p id=37de9fa0-c8d1-012c-ee93-12313b030611>To use the sample:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Click the &ldquo;Check Region Manager&rdquo; button. It should work OK.</li>\r\n<li>Click the &ldquo;Remove View From Region&rdquo; button. It should remove the HelloWorldView which holds another region (&ldquo;MyNewRegion&rdquo;).</li>\r\n<li>Click the &ldquo;Check Region Manager&rdquo; button again. It should throw an exception as the region &ldquo;MyNewRegion&rdquo; does no exist.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p id=37dec320-c8d1-012c-ee94-12313b030611>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=37ded310-c8d1-012c-ee95-12313b030611>Damian Schenkelman    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

My scenario has another level of views - I have uploaded the sample <a title=\"Sample Download\" href=\"http://cid-52f91400edc96055.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/MySilverlightPrism.zip\">here</a>&nbsp;- which is a silverlight project - with the exact behavior. In the right region I have 2 sub-views which are not removed when I remove the parent region.<br>If you have the time please take a look at this simple sample.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,<br>Jimmi.</p>",
