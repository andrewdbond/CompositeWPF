    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nThe issue you are facing is related to having the new downloaded source code on the same folder location that <strong>Prism 4.1</strong> was before. By doing this, the solution would find the old <strong>Prism 4.1</strong> assemblies that were built before, making it to throw a versioning error as <strong>Prism 4.1</strong> old assemblies were configured for <strong>Net 4.0</strong>.\r<br />\n<br />\nIn order to solve the problem, extract the <strong>Prism 4.2</strong> zipped folder into a new empty folder and build the <strong>Prism Library</strong> solution. Notice that <strong>Blend for Net 4.5</strong> would be needed to be installed in the machine which it would actually be installed automatically with <strong>Visual Studio's</strong> update.\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope this helps, \r<br />\nRegards.\r<br />\n<br />\nGabriel Ostrowsky\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky</a><br />\n",
