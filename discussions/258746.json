For this I was referring to Prism Quick start apps that comes with Prism download (ModularitywithMef in Silverlight).</p>\r\n<p>I am getting lot of errors, when I apply this logic. You can download the sample app from this url and help me to trouble shoot it.

The masters module is directly reference in the application and hence it works but for orders i want to load it on demand , by clicking on the hyperlink button. I have configure the ondemand\r\n download in xaml file (Catalogs.xaml).</p>\r\n<p>Please let me know if you need any further info.</p>\r\n<p>Kindly help.</p>\r\n<p>Regards</p>\r\n<p>Goldy</p>\r\n",
