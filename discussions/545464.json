When I hit next, I want to navigate to View #2. When I do this currently, and load View #2 into the same region, it doesn't hide View #1, it just adds it to the region and they stack on top of each other. \r<br />\n<br />\nHow can I make only one view display in a region at any time, and have the newly navigated to view be the only view that is displaying. Thanks.<br />\n",
