The problem I came across is having one module throw an event through EventAggregator and some other module which is loaded only on demand to catch that event.</p>\r\n<p>In other words, I need some non hacking way to load a module which needs that event (of course I need some way to know which module to load for which event) and then throw an event to that module.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also, I have a solution with navigating between on demand modules via silverlight navigation control, but I don't like it. I won't go into details here, but I want to know what is the best way to do this kind of navigation.</p>\r\n<p>So any detailed guidance on how to go about these issues would be much&nbsp;appreciated!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Paulius</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi Paulius,</p>\r\n<p>I do not know your exact scenario, but based on my understanding your application raises an event from a module and it is necessary to handle this event from another module, which is loaded on demand.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, I think that you could specify a module dependency for achieving your scenario. For more information on this topic, you could take a look at the following documentation section on MSDN:\r\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405479%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">Chapter 4: Modular Application Development</a>, see the\r\n<em>Specifying Module Dependencies</em> section.</p>\r\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero <br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>\r\n",
