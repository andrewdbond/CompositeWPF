    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi Massoud,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Prism provides guidance for communication between loosely components (like your modules).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One way to fulfill this scenario is to use <strong>Shared Services</strong>. As documentation shows\r\n<em>&quot;...When the modules are loaded, modules add their services to the service locator. Typically, services are registered and retrieved from a service locator by common interface types. This allows modules to use services provided by other modules without\r\n requiring a static reference to the module. Service instances are shared across modules, so you can share data and pass messages between modules.</em>&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can read more about <strong>Shared Services</strong> in <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921122%28v=PandP.40%29.aspx\">\r\nChapter 9: Communicating Between Loosely Coupled Components</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Also you might find useful the following links:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921140%28v=PandP.40%29.aspx\">Chapter 3: Managing Dependencies Between Components</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405479%28v=PandP.40%29.aspx\">Chapter 4: Modular Application Development</a>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this information handy</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Miguel Bronzovic<br>\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
