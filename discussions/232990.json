I checked this and it works with the RadRibbon using View Injection.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, I realized that in the <strong>CreateRegion </strong>method of the\r\n<strong>QATBRegionAdapter </strong>class it is creating a <strong>Region </strong>\r\ninstance instead of an <strong>AllActiveRegion </strong>instance. In general the second one is returned for UI Controls that derives from the\r\n<strong>ItemsControl</strong> class. Have you tried to add more than one view to your region?</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
