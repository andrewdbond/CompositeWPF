You could also try running the application in another computer, to discard that the cause of your performance issues is the computer itself.</p>\r\n<p>If you can't find out where the problem lies, it would be helpful if you could provide us more information about your scenario.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>\r\n",
