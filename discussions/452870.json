When I use them in a project I get the following error:<br />\n<pre><code>Error   90  Assembly 'Microsoft.Practices.Prism.UnityExtensions, Version=4.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' uses 'Microsoft.Practices.Unity, Version=3.0.1208.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' which has a higher version than referenced assembly 'Microsoft.Practices.Unity, Version=3.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35'   </code></pre>\n\nI thought that the unity 3 release was supposed to fix this.\r<br />\n<br />\nAm I missing something here?\r<br />\n<br />\nWhere do I have to pull the assemblies for both prism and unity from in order for them to work together for .net 4.5 (without having to ildasm them or rebuild them...we want to use the assemblies as released by Microsoft).\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!\r<br />\n<br />\nGlenn<br />\n",
