Context clears cause of I implemented INavigationAware and IRegionMemberLifetime interfaces. I implemnted these interfaces cause of I need to recreate views  and view models every navigation step.</p>\n<p>You'll find two solutions: before and after. In the first solution views and views models are not recreated when you navigated to the first view, back and to the first view again. But Context still exists. In the second solution, views and view models are  recreated but context loses.</p>\n<p><a title=\"PrismNavigationSample.zip\" href=\"https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=09f9aac932650216&amp;resid=9F9AAC932650216!140\">PrismNavigationSample</a></p>\n<p>What I'm doing wrong?</p>",
