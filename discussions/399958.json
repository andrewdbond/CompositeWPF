On the other take into account that as far I know there is no official guidance regarding <strong>Entity Framework</strong> in <strong>Prism </strong>as it was designed as a guidance for the client-side of the application. Therefore, in case your concern is related to the implementation of this framework I believe you could find better guidance on this subject for example in the <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/dataplatformdev\">ADO.NET Entity Framework Forums</a>.<br /><br />Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>Based on my understanding, <strong>WPF </strong>applications will only use the config file named <strong>YourMainProject.exe.config </strong>which is by default the<strong> App.config </strong>file defined in your main project, and as only one config file is loaded for the whole application, the connection string that is in your <strong>Business.Data</strong> project will not be used.</p>\r\n<p>Hence in order to avoid this kind of error, your connection string should be defined in your <strong>Shell </strong>project's<strong> App.Config</strong> file. In my experience I have always followed this approach. Regarding your application, I added the connection string to the main config file, and changed the code to filter books with and <strong>Id </strong>that exists in your database, and could verify that your view model bindings work correctly.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>",
