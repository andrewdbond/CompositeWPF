    "Html": "Hi Dirk,\r<br />\n<br />\nAs you mentioned, <strong>Prism</strong> uses a version of the <strong>ServiceLocator</strong> which targets the <strong>mscorlib.dll 2.0.0.0</strong> version. Based on my understanding, this is because when <strong>Prism 4.1</strong> was released, that was the latest version of the <strong>ServiceLocator</strong> library available.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have checked the <a href=\"http://commonservicelocator.codeplex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ServiceLocator's CodePlex</a> site and it seems that a newer version is available in the from of a <strong>Portable Class Library</strong> which targets <strong>Silverlight 4</strong> and higher (so I suppose it is using the 4.0.0.0 version of the <strong>mscorlib.dll</strong> .) You can find it in their downloads page:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://commonservicelocator.codeplex.com/releases/view/17694\" rel=\"nofollow\">Common Service Locator - Download Page</a>, third link.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nAs a quick workaround, you can try updating <strong>Prism's</strong> source code to reference this new version of the <strong>ServiceLocator</strong> and recompile the library.\r<br />\nAlso, you can create a issue in the <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/workitem/list/advanced\" rel=\"nofollow\">Issue Tracker</a> section requesting to update the <strong>Prism</strong> library to the latest version of the <strong>ServiceLocator</strong> , so that it could be take into account by the p&amp;p team for a future release.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nDamian Cherubini\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a><br />\n",
