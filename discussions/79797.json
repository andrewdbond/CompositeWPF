Thus, the code below will provide you with two different instances:</p>\r\n<p id=64bafa60-dcfe-012c-a19b-12313d018871>\r\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White\">\r\n<pre>IMyView view1 = container.Resolve&lt;IMyView&gt;();\r\nIMyView view2 = container.Resolve&lt;IMyView&gt;();\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\nIn the scenario when you do want to obtain the same view instance, you could keep a reference to that view and add it to the various regions or mark it as a singleton in the Unity container.</p>\r\n<p id=64bb1a10-dcfe-012c-a19c-12313d018871>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=64bb3ad0-dcfe-012c-a19d-12313d018871>Damian Schenkelman    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The exception you will get if you have two content controls for instance is an <strong>InvalidOperationException</strong> with the following message <em>&quot;Specified element is already the logical child of another element. Disconnect it first.&quot; </em>(other controls might not throw this same exception but it will not work anyways).</p>\r\n<p id=ccdfd560-ddc1-012c-4734-12313d018871>You can take advantage of the fact that one of the regions is hidden, to remove the view from one of the regions and place it in the other one.</p>\r\n<p id=ccdfff50-ddc1-012c-4735-12313d018871>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=cce01dd0-ddc1-012c-4736-12313d018871>Damian Schenkelman    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
