The contents of a module depends mostly of the personal preferences of each developer and requirements of each application. So in my opinion, as the content of each module is defined by the developer, it's not be possible to have \"standard\" modules implemented.</p>\r\n<p>You can find more information about modules and how they are used in modular applications in the following chapter of the Prism documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405479(v=PandP.40).aspx\">Chapter 4: Modular Application Development in MSDN</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
