    "Html": "Hi Rafael,\r<br />\n<br />\nBasically the decision mainly depends on what you and your team are more comfortable with each framework, and if the main features of your app would be provided by <strong>Prism</strong> in a simple manner.\r<br />\n<br />\nFirstly, the technologies you mentioned you would be using are supported by Prism. Indeed, Prism already provides several functionalities regarding dependency injection with <strong>Unity</strong>. You can find some related information on the following <strong>MSDN Prism</strong> chapter:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921140(v=pandp.40).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">3: Managing Dependencies Between Components</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nI would suggest you then to checkout the main features provided by <strong>Prism</strong> in the following <strong>MSDN Prism Guide</strong> chapters in order to evaluate how it would help you implement the application requirements:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430868(v=pandp.40).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">2: Initializing Prism Applications</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405479(v=pandp.40).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">4: Modular Application Development</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921098(v=pandp.40).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">7: Composing the User Interface</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430861(v=pandp.40).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">8: Navigation</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nI hope this helped you,\r<br />\nRegards.\r<br />\nGabriel Ostrowsky\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky</a><br />\n",
