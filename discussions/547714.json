Whenever I open a View in the Visual Studio 2013 (with update 2) XAML designer, I get an error message: <br />\n&quot;Your views must implement IView&quot;<br />\na squiggly appears under the code:<br />\nprism:ViewModelLocator.AutoWireViewModel=&quot;True&quot;<br />\n<br />\nThis is true even though my views implement IView.<br />\n<br />\nYou can experience this problem for yourself in the Prism 5 sample &quot;MVVM Quickstart&quot; (BasicMVVMQuickstart_Desktop.sln) when you open MainWindow.xaml. Although it compiles and runs ok.<br />\n<br />\nI cannot figure out what is causing this error. This designer error doesn't go away, even if I edit the sample code in MainWindow.xaml.cs to explicitly implement IView:<br />\n<pre><code>public partial class MainWindow : Window, IView</code></pre>\n\n...<br />\n<br />\nHow can I get this designer error to go away?<br />\n<br />\nP.S. This forum needs a &quot;Prism V5 - WPF&quot; topic.<br />\n<br />\nP.P.S. Many thank to everyone that creating Prism 5 and it's excellent documentation.<br />\n",

As VCDeveloper mentioned this shouldn't generate any issue at compilation time.<br />\n<br />\nIf you want, go ahead and create a new Work Item for this so the p&amp;p team can consider this for future releases.<br />\n<br />\nThanks,<br />\nEzequiel<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net</a><br />\n",
