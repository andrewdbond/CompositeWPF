The common approach is placing this kind of classes in the infrastructure project so they can be referenced from your different modules.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"View.aspx?ThreadId=70616\">This thread</a> provides some information and a couple of links about managing Views/ViewModels across an entire application, so you might find it useful.</p>\r\n<p id=39b20ff0-f2f5-012c-1d37-12313900f081>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=39b22170-f2f5-012c-1d38-12313900f081>Damian Schenkelman    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>",
