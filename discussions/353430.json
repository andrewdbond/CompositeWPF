    "Html": "<p>Hi,<br /> <br /> As far as I now currently there is no official guidance in Prism regarding this kind of functionality.</p>\n<p>However, you might find that there are several articles in the web discussing different approaches on how to implement these scenarios. In my opinion which implementation you use will depend mostly on your personal preferences and the requirements of your  scenario.</p>\n<p>For example, as mentioned in this <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/72280\"> thread</a>, if you what are you looking is adding functionality to commit or rollback changes to an object that is used as a data source, you may benefit from the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.ieditableobject.aspx\"> IEditableObject Interface</a>.</p>\n<p>Also you could find the approach mentioned in the following blog post interesting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wpftutorial.net/UndoRedo.html\">How to implement undo/redo using MVVM</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other hand, you could achieved Navigation Undo-Redo Functionality (that is, going back and forward between views in a specific region) using the <strong>Navigation Journal</strong> provided by Prism. You could find more information about the use of the Navigation Journal in <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430861%28v=pandp.40%29.aspx\">Chapter 8: Navigation</a> of the Prism documentation.</p>\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>",
