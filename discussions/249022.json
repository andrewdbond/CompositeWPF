You can read more about shared services in <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/249022\">this chapter</a> from the Prism MSDN documentation.</p>\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
