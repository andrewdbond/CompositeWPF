I'd like to seperate all the modules from one another and from the shell application. I want to put each module into its own subfolder within a &quot;Modules&quot; subfolder. Via the configuration store I can tell the shell app where it can find the modules. So far everything works ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a module gets loaded the runtime loads the module's dependent assemblies and looks for them within the application root folder (where the Shell.exe resides). But I want the dependent assemblies to be in the modules' subfolder and be loaded from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope my explanation made sense. Can anyone help me on this one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiao,<br>\r\nJens<br>\r\n",
