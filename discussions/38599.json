In other words, we have different state of these regions, it's the user that switch between a context or another. To reproduce the original case, the user could switch between some companies and the regions should initialize or restore with the views of each module, maintaining the state. Some views could be &quot;singleton&quot;, that is be the same across different companies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would you manage this situation?<br>\r\nConsidering that I want to &quot;centralize&quot; this business logic, leaving the life simple to the module (retrieve the region, add and activate).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n",
