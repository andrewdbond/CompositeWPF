In that view, I try to&nbsp;register for&nbsp;the MouseWheel event:</p>\r\n<p>this.MouseWheel += new MouseWheelEventHandler(TargetViewView_MouseWheel);</p>\r\n<p>I put a handler in place and see that... it never gets called!</p>\r\n<p>I don't know if this has anything to do with the Prism region / view architecture, so I'm not sure if this post belongs on this forum. But I want to see if anyone has come across mouse wheel problems in the Prism context before...</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Dave</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
