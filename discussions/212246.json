    "Html": "Why are modules coupled to Regions in the Shell? Why not allow the shell to inject the region into the module? It seems to me that the a module must define it's region by name and this seems backwards as a module should not at all care which region it is used in.\r\n\r\nI understand that the shell can bind to the name of the region defined in the module but this seems like extra work when the region can be injected into the module by the shell which also decouples the module from the shell. Is there any way to do accomplish this?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, in some module:\r\n\r\npublic void Initialize()\r\n{\r\nregionViewRegistry.RegisterViewWithRegion(&quot;MainRegion&quot;, typeof(Views.View1));\r\n}\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhy does/should the module care what the named region is is going to be viewed in?  \r\n\r\nWhy not something like\r\n\r\n\r\npublic void Initialize(Region region)\r\n{\r\nregionViewRegistry.RegisterViewWithRegion(region, typeof(Views.View1));\r\n}\r\n\r\nor something similar?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This  is because modules are not part of the user interface. They might  contain views, which compose the UI, and those are the ones that can be  added to regions. You can find more detailed explanations of that  difference in these threads:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"View.aspx?ThreadId=62400\">Manually  load module</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"View.aspx?ThreadId=59827\">Confirmation  of understanding</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>As for the question itself, you can  find an explanation of why the module is in charge of the UI  composition in <a href=\"View.aspx?ThreadId=48654\">this  thread</a>, along with an explanation of other possible approaches, and  their pros and cons.</p>\r\n<p id=05a259c0-401f-012d-1292-12313d013db1>I  hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p id=05a26f40-401f-012d-1293-12313d013db1>Guido Leandro Maliandi    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
