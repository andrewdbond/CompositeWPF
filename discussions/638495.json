I don't see it being used in the <strong>Adventure Works Shopper</strong>, but I'm assuming even though its not the <strong>ApplicationDataContainer</strong> still should be use for <strong>App</strong> <em>Settings</em> correct?<br />\n",

    "Html": "The current code base was developed against the WinRT APIs first and then ported to Universal apps, so it did not really take ApplicationDataContainer into consideration. But in terms of application settings, the sessions state service is meant for storing transient data (i.e. data that is held in memory on the client side that has not been persisted anywhere) that you want to keep around if an app goes through a suspend-terminate-resume cycle. App settings that are more configuration settings that should always be there, so you would use other means such as the ApplicationDataContainer for those.<br />\n",
