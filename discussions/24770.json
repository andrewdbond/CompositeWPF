If <span class=\"codeInline\" style=\"font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace;\">IMetadataInfo</span> is a core prism interface then I'd prefer to see it slimmer. That said, if it does stay I'd prefer it be defined as:<br /><br /><pre style=\"background-color:#ECECEC; border:dashed .1em #3E62A6; font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace; font-size:1em; margin-top:0; padding:.5em; height:auto; overflow:auto; overflow-x:auto; overflow-y:auto;\">\r\npublic ImageSource Icon { get; }\r\n</pre>This will allow you to use <i>any</i> WPF image as the icon rather than only those that can be loaded via a URI. Here's a concocted use case: modules are stored in a DB and their images are stored in a separate field so that the image can be updated independently of the module (and maybe change on a per-user basis). Therefore, it would be nice to be able to suck the image straight from the DB into an <span class=\"codeInline\" style=\"font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace;\">ImageSource</span> and assign that directly.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Kent<br />",
