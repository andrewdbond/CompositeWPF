It seems that there is problem during loading &quot;Calendar&quot;, actually, any module can not be loaded (for example, I only define one module in ModulesCatalog.xaml, then load it, the same error still there), I could not figure out what could be wrong. I must miss some&nbsp;critical stuff.&nbsp;Could someone give your insight suggestions? Thanks lot!</p>",

    "Html": "\r\nHi, Fernando:<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI re-check the issue(s) and find something which seem related with the reference of &quot;Micorsoft.practices.Prism.MefExtensions&quot;. I am quite confused by the phenomena, I describe as follow, hope to get some of your insight suggestions.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHere are the processes I conducted, hope they are helpful to you understanding my issue, please let me know what step(s) I did was (were) wrong or you have some restriction by referencing Prism library:<br>\r\n <br>\r\n1. Download Drop 8.<br>\r\n2. Run Desktop & Silverlight - Open Prism Library.bat. Successfully compile all projects.<br>\r\n3. Extract comonents DLL from different folders to form a new library folder, say &quot;MyPrismLibrary&quot;, example, copy the new generated &quot;Microsoft.Practices.Prism.MefExtensions.dll&quot; to &quot;MyPrismLibrary&quot;, etc.<br>\r\n4. Go to Quickstarts - Navigation - Open RegionNavigation.Silverlight solution<br>\r\n5. Go to RegionNavigation project - go to reference - remove Microsoft.practices.Prism.MefExtensions - ADD this DLL from new generated &quot;MyPrismLibrary&quot;<br>\r\n6. Run application. The I got following errors. Note the error is random, one could show this (see attach Figure 1), another could show this (see attach Figure 2).<br>\r\n7. Then I remove this reference again, add ORIGINAL reference from LIB folder. Error not gone, still there.<br>\r\n8. If I un-zip a brand-new drop 8, go to Navigation folder to run the application, everything is fine. The important point is that this setting now is exactly the same as above step #7. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhat are wrong? I am completely baffled. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThank you very much!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShirley<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br> <br>\r\n\r\n<hr id=stopSpelling>\r\nFrom: [email removed]<br>To: [email removed]<br>Date: Wed, 29 Sep 2010 11:20:45 -0700<br>Subject: Re: Runtime error: Module TypeLoadingException was unhandled by user code [CompositeWPF:228936]<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: fantivero<br>\r\n<div id=ecxThreadNotificationPostBody>\r\nHi,<br>\r\nThis is certainly strange, I faced with the same situation and found no issues by performing this change.
