In the DialogViewModel I defined a Command, which gets executed when a dialog should be shown. I make this command as global command, by defining a static CompositeCommand and registering the DelegateCommand.</p>\r\n<p>When I start the application I have a datagrid. Everytime the selectedObjects in this grid are changing I am calling the RaiseCanExecuteChanged-method. This is working properly.<br>Ok not perfectly, because the first object in the grid I select will not give me the expected behaviour! It will always give me a null value as parameter, although the RaiseCanExecuteChanged-method is called after I set my SelectedEntities-Property and my Command is bound to this property. When I click a second object everything is like expected.</p>\r\n<p>I am not sure why this is happening. I am calling the RaiseCanExecuteChanged-method to ensure, that the databinding is correct at the time. Before I did that the CanExecute-Method was only called once at the beginning and never again.</p>\r\n<p>Has anybody a suggestion?</p>",
