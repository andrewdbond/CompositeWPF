I have an instance of the shell region manager in a presenter that was passed in via the constructor as IRegionManager.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I recently made two changes to the TabControlRegionAdaptor and recompiled the Composite.Presentation.dll - they were the TabItem HeaderTemplate fix (suggested here: http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=4599) and I also wrapped TabItem with a custom TabItem which does some stuff OnApplyTemplate. I don't see how that could suddenly make the Count() method unavailable in the region, but could it?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Just really confused as I see plenty of examples like this:</p>\r\n<p>IRegion mainRegion = regionManager.Regions[regionName];</p>\r\n<p>int viewsAmount = mainRegion.Views.Count();</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That snippet will not compile for me....</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions and apologies if I am missing something really obvious....</p>",
