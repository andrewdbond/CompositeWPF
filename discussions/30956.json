It's easy to understand and to customize. <br>\r\nI found however some handy thing now that might be useful to others and that are missing from the default install package. Here's just a few:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Region adapters for toolbarpanel, Menu and MenuItem<br>\r\n- Custom styles to make it possible to display the title of a view as the header of a tabitem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs there a contrib project where I can upload these additions to? Or is there any other way to contribute?<br>\r\n",
