The sample project is a very basic version of what I am currently using. Could you have a look and see if I am doing everything properly? I am a bit concerned as to whether Views and View Models are being disposed of correctly.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have added deconstructors to View2ViewModel and View2. These appear to get fired 3 times after:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Navigate to View</li>\n<li>Close</li>\n<li>Navigate to View </li>\n<li>\nClose again<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nIs this correct?\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso if you:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Navigate to view</li>\n<li>Close</li>\n<li>\nFire Test Event<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nIt appears to have hit the event subscription, even though that should have been removed.\r<br />\n<br />\nWould be good if you could have a look. Thanks!<br />\n",
