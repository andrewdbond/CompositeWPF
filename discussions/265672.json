This also applies for views added to regions via navigation (using the <strong>Region.RequestNavigate</strong> method).</p>\r\n<p>You can read more about this in the following chapters from the Prism MSDN documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921098%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">Chapter 7: Composing the User Interface</a> </li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430861%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">Chapter 8: Navigation</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>",
