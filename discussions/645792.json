I have few design and architecture related basic questions that i want to consider in order to have loose coupled application which is the prime idea of this framework.<br />\n<ol>\n<li>In MVVM, can Model contain the behaviors and is it a good way to implement INotifyPropertyChanged interface in it?</li>\n<li>Is it necessary to have one shell with fixed regions across the whole application?</li>\n<li>Can we have multiple shells, module wise in the same application?</li>\n<li>When we navigate to View how can we specify some specific ViewModel to associate with it.</li>\n<li>Is there any approach to navigate to ViewModel and ViewModel should know about their associated view, preferably using Uri (for loose coupling)?</li>\n<li>There is also a Caliburn-Micro framework which is similar to Prism. I want to ask that why one should consider using Prism over it?</li>\n</ol>\n",
