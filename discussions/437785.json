Modules should have an Initialize method.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nYou can find the sample below:<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://sdrv.ms/11DIEMz\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prism Splash sample (Prism 4.1)</a><br />\n<br />\nHope this helps,<br />\n<br />\nFederico Martinez <br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez</a><br />\n",
