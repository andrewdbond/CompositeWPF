    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>Based on my understanding, this exception might be caused if you set the content property of the control that contains the region. In Prism you are not allowed to associate a control with content and a region, as the content registered within that region will be loaded there at run time, hence you will probably have issues if you remove that condition and defined additional content in your control. By design controls associated to regions should be kept as empty containers.</p>\r\n<p>If you are interested, you could find useful information about Prism region implementation in the following chapter of the Prism documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921098(v=pandp.40).aspx\">Chapter 7: Composing the User Interface</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>",
