Alos, when the &quot;DetailView&quot; is visible, the user should have the possibility to change the height of the two different view by means of a seperator (the seperator should not be visible if the DetailView doesnt have any customers to show).</p>\r\n<p>If you understand what i try to achive do you have any idea how i would do this with Prism V2 and the MVVM approach?</p>\r\n<p>Any help very much appreciated!!!!</p>\r\n<p>Best Regards</p>\r\n<p>niclas</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
