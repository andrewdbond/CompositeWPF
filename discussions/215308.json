There are 4 different ways for <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff647735.aspx\">communication</a>&nbsp;supported by Prism out-of-the-box.</p>\r\n<p id=1f992ab0-7890-012d-198b-12313b101101>However, based on your specs you could use <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff647735.aspx\">Shared Services</a> (see the <em>Shared Service</em> section), which is also cross-module like Event Aggregator. From the documentation at MSDN: <em>Service instances are shared across modules, so you can share data and <strong>pass messages</strong> between modules.</em></p>\r\n<p id=1f994cf0-7890-012d-198c-12313b101101>Therefore, it seems to be the right solution for you, and it is simple to use by registering your service, as shown in the following code:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p id=1f9970f0-7890-012d-198d-12313b101101>protected void RegisterViewsAndServices() <br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _container.RegisterType&lt;IMarketFeedService, MarketFeedService&gt;(new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager()); <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //... <br>}</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p id=1f999320-7890-012d-198e-12313b101101>For more information about this, you could take a look at the following documentation section:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff650141.aspx\">How to: Register and Use Services</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p id=1f99b3f0-7890-012d-198f-12313b101101>Additionally, in the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff647434.aspx\">Stock Trader RI</a>, you'll find an example (see the <strong>RegisterViewsAndServices</strong> method in <strong>MarketModule.cs</strong>).</p>\r\n<p id=1f99f5e0-7890-012d-1991-12313b101101>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=1f9a1700-7890-012d-1992-12313b101101>Fernando Antivero <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>",

It no longer appears in the Stock Trader RI example. The comments in \"MarketModule.cs\" say this:&nbsp;\"This module is intentionally left empty because views, services, and other types are discovered through declarative attributes. View registration for this module is done through the ViewExportAttribute.\"</p>\r\n<p>So basically, the MSDN documentation is no longer useful. I am unable to find examples of the \"new\" way of the ViewExportAttribute approach.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks, though, for the \"How to\" link. I hand never found that page. It's probably written for VS2008, but at least it's something that appears to be useful.</p>",
