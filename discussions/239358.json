I am trying to load this module into a PRISM Shell which uses PRISM 2.2. In my module, I am having constructor\r\n which accepts IUnityContainer as parameter.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When I tried to load the module, following error message is thrown and module load fails.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;The current type, Microsoft.Practices.Unity.IUnityContainer, is an interface and cannot be constructed. Are you missing a type mapping?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Any one has faced this problem before?</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Madhan</p>\r\n",

This might be the cause of the exception you're experiencing.</p>\r\n<p id=\"x_e8eef2d0-f0cf-012d-ff8b-123139181d06\">It is recommended to use the same version of Prism across your application. You might find\r\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921144%28v=PandP.20%29.aspx\">this documentation</a> useful, which refers to upgrading versions and changes between Prism 2.x versions.</p>\r\n<p id=\"x_e8ef0770-f0cf-012d-ff8d-123139181d06\">I hope you find this information useful.</p>\r\n<p id=\"x_e8ef1320-f0cf-012d-ff8e-123139181d06\">Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Miguel Bronzovic<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic\">http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

So went ahead and renamed the assemblies to be same. I checked on the IUnityContainer and UnityContainer types for change in the\r\n definition between Unity 2.0 and Unity 1.2. There were no changes. So I am wondering why it is broken.</p>\r\n<p>I am working on a enterprise LOB application where different applications will be loaded into same shell and applications can be developed in different time frames which will result in different PRISM framework being used.</p>\r\n<p>The URL related to upgrade changes are talking about migrating from PRISM June 2008 to PRISM Feb 2009. I am looking for document which talks about PRISM Oct 2009 to PRISM May 2010.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Madhan</p>\r\n",
