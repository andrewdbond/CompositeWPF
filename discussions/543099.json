    "Html": "Hi Peter,\r<br />\n<br />\nOne possible cause could be that the first Nuget is still installed in the corresponding Project that raise the exception. Therefore, the error mentioned above is raised when trying to load the same assembly from another Nuget or assembly reference.\r<br />\n<br />\nIt would be helpful if you could describe which project is raising the error, and what Prism related assemblies it references. I suggest you verify every Nuget package installed in the solution and which projects would be installed on.\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope this helped you,\r<br />\nRegards.\r<br />\n<br />\nGabriel Ostrowsky\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky</a><br />\n",
