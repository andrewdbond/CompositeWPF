Meaning that when the event was suppose to be fired, MyWorkItem wasn't register to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\npublic class MyWorkItem : WorkItem<br>\r\n{<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [CommandHandler(&quot;...&quot;)]<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void foo(object, EventArgs)<br>\r\n}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I created a Controller class, registered a handle from there, but added the controller from MyWorkItem::InitializeServices(), suddenly both foo &amp; foo2 <br>\r\ngot called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\npublic class MyController: Controller<br>\r\n{<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [CommandHandler(&quot;...&quot;)]<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void foo2(object, EventArgs)<br>\r\n}<br>\r\n<br>\r\npublic class MyWorkItem  : WorkItem<br>\r\n{<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [CommandHandler(&quot;...&quot;)]<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void foo(object, EventArgs)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protected&nbsp; override InitializeServices()<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  this.Parent.Services.AddNew&lt;MyController&gt;();<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>\r\n<br>\r\n}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do ? <br>\r\nShould Commands be handled NOT in WorkItems ?<br>\r\nShould I hack the CABUI code to always register the event in the parent workitem (CommandStrategy::RegisterCommandHandlers)?<br>\r\nAny other suggestions ? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks alot in advance<br>\r\nYoav S.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S<br>\r\nI'm currently using the CABUI and not prism (I understood that the only difference was with the Workspaces.... hope it's right and I didn't bother the wrong discussion board...)<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "Hi Yoav S,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are more differences between the CompositeWPF (aka Prism) and CAB/SCSF than the Workspace (it's a totally different infrastructure), e.g. doesn't have WorkItems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf your a newbie I would highly recommend the Smart Client Software Factory at <a href=\"http://www.CodePlex.com/SmartClient\">http://www.CodePlex.com/SmartClient</a> - it is a higher level than CAB and has code generators (guidance packages) to do the bulk of the work for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you create your SCSF application you will want to register your command handlers in the ModuleController.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI learned a great deal from the gurus in the Smart Client forum - I trust they'll help you get started!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
