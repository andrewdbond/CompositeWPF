In order to do this, the application defines a shared service (the <strong>IAuthorizationService</strong>) to obtain a list of modules  depending of a parameter (the role of the user) and then, load the  modules specified in this list through the Prism's <strong>ModuleManager</strong>. I believe that this approach might be similar to the functionality you want to achieve.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
