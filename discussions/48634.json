As I understand regions, I would need to replace the above with something like:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        &lt;ItemsControl Name=&quot;LibraryFilterRegion&quot; <br>\r\n                      Grid.Row=&quot;0&quot;<br>\r\n                      Grid.ColumnSpan=&quot;2&quot;                      <br>\r\n                      Regions:RegionManager.RegionName=&quot;LibraryFilterRegion&quot; /&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would be the recommended approach to still exposing this properties to be edited by a designer in Blend, etc? \r\n",
