    "Html": "Hi, \r<br />\n<br />\nI have tried to reproduce your problem, but both approaches you mentioned worked successfully on my solution.\r<br />\nFor <em>Runtime</em> execution, you would not need any other implementation rather than the <strong><em>Image</em></strong> control definition in the <strong>Shell</strong> or <strong>UserControl</strong> View. If you would like to see the image in <em>DesignTime</em> instead, you would need to additionally reference the external assembly on the specific project.\r<br />\n<br />\nAnyway, regarding your problem I would suggest you to verify the external assembly location:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Assembly file</em></strong> should be placed on the <strong><em>Debug</em></strong> or <strong><em>Release</em></strong> folder where the solution builds and runs.</li>\n<li>\nThe path of the image inside the assembly would be <em>relative to the root assembly</em>. So if you have the <strong><em>Image</em></strong> folder placed on the root of the project assembly, the source path would be as you correctly described.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nif this did not help you, it would be helpful if you could explain what in particular would not work.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards.\r<br />\nGabriel Ostrowsky\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky</a><br />\n",
