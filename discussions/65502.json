I don't want to hardcode the device's address into the module code. I would like it to be configurable. What are some ways I can accomplish this?</p>\r\n<p>I prefer to not have an ad hoc configuration file on a per-module basis. Ideally, I'd put configuration information directly in the &lt;module&gt; element in App.config and CAL would somehow make this information available to the module during its construction or in its Initialize() method.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>\r\n<p>Best,</p>\r\n<p>Dave</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
