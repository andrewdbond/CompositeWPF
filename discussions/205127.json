We examined our other buttons and found that in every working case, the buttons were contained in something that had a ContentControl in the template (e.g. BlackLight clipping border) or itself was derived from ContentControl (e.g. ScrollViewer).</p>\r\n<p>I did a modicum of digging around to see if this was expected behavior or at least known behavior but didn't find much. Would you consider this a bug? Is there any good reason why XAML declared command bindings in a lonely little StackPanel or Grid with no ContenControl shouldn't get parsed?</p>",
