    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nIt is strange that this section of the Prism library no longer works for you in <strong>Windows 8</strong>. Also,  I believe we haven't received any similar issues before. Therefore, it would be helpful if you can provide more information about the context of the application, like where and when you are executing this code so we can look at this in further detail.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso, we noticed that you are a using a <strong>lock</strong> statement, so we assume that your code is being called by different threads. If that is the case, it would be helpful to know if those are <strong>UI</strong> threads, <strong>background</strong> threads, etc. as <strong>Prism</strong> work not work correctly in every kind of thread.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\n<br />\nFederico Martinez \r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez</a><br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi Yair,\r<br />\n<br />\nI haven't been able to reproduce this issue either by using the <strong>Prism QuickStarts</strong> or other samples. Hence, I believe there could be another component in your application that might be firing this problem.\r<br />\n<br />\nAs a quick test, please try to deactivate the current active view just right before activating the second one and check if this issue keeps appearing.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf this does not help, it would be useful to know if there is any custom behavior or logic that might be affecting the views, like for example, if the views are being reordered automatically inside the region using a <strong>SortComparison</strong>, etc. If this is not the case, then it would be helpful if you could provide us with a repro sample application so that we can analyze this problem in further detail.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\n<br />\nDamian Cherubini\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a><br />\n",
