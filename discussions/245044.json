I have some issues with it, so, dear community members, I need help :)</p>\r\n<p>Scenario.</p>\r\n<p>Silverlight4&#43;Prism4&#43;MEF(included in sl4)&#43;TelerikDocking with custom RegionAdapter (I think that my issues are not on telerik controls side). 2 Regions &ndash; one for navigation and one for tabs in docking control. 2 modules:1.<span>\r\n</span>ModuleCOnlyView &ndash; module with one View, registered with RegisterViewWithRegion() method2.<span>\r\n</span>ModuleBButtonPlusView &ndash; module with button and view.</p>\r\n<p>I prepared test project, you can download it here&nbsp;<a title=\"http://cid-b16922e1fb07cd95.office.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/Prism4MefTelerikDocking.zip\" href=\"http://cid-b16922e1fb07cd95.office.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/Prism4MefTelerikDocking.zip\">http://cid-b16922e1fb07cd95.office.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/Prism4MefTelerikDocking.zip</a></p>\r\n<p>I have deleted references for telerik controls, but you can download trial from their site and reference Telerik.Windows.Controls, Telerik.Windows.Controls.Docking and Telerik.Windows.Controls.Navigation in Prism4MefTelerikDocking project.</p>\r\n<p>All my question and issues have //NOTE: marks in code.</p>\r\n<p>1.<span> </span>When I click on button ModuleB_Button &ndash; new tab added to dock control. When I try to close that tab (with x button) exception is being thrown, but view is actually removed! (I have found similar problem http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=242932\r\n but no answer). Exception: ArgumentException: The region does not contain the specified view. Parameter name: view. Look at Note 1 in code.</p>\r\n<p>2.<span> </span>If I navigate to region with RegionManager.RequestNavigate(&hellip;) (ModuleBButtonPlusViewNavigationItem.xaml.cs) then I can&rsquo;t get view with the GetView(string viewName) method (note 2). I know, that I need to use &nbsp;this.RegionManager.Regions[&quot;&hellip;&quot;].Add(&hellip;);\r\n method to access view by its name, but in this case NavigationService.Navigating event won&rsquo;t fire (I need it to implement some specific logic there). Is there any elegant way to retrieve specific view by name on the Module side?</p>\r\n<p>3.<span> </span>Note 3. In IViewCollection CollectionChanged event with Reset action fires immediately after CollectionChanged event with Add action. Why?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n",
