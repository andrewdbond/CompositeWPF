If a logon is successful, I need to hide or destroy the Logon view, and show the Live Messenger UI. How then would I&nbsp;dynamically replace the 'MainRegion' to&nbsp;adding new&nbsp;regions like 'Status', 'Contact List', 'Toolbars' in shell.xaml?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, I can create a module with local regions and display it inside the MainRegion, but I would like to make 'Status', 'Contact List', 'Toolbars' into separate modules, I don't think it's possible to display a view from a module to a local region defined in another module, is it? Thanks for any suggestions.\r\n",
