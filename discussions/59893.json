However, at the moment of registering the views, you are not able to get the region manager because it is being set after the registration is done.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0pt 0.6pt\"><span style=\"color:#1f497d\" lang=EN-US><span style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:small\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0pt -0.6pt\"><span style=\"\" lang=EN-US><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\"><span style=\"font-size:small\">This is the typical scenario where <strong>ViewDiscovery</strong> should be used, since you do not know whether a region with that name will be registered but you know your view has to be shown in it. The benefit is that the region does not have to exist at the time of registration, so you do not have to worry about whether the region has already been created or not (no timing initialization issues). As you said, what is probably happening is that your views are being registered before the search view is added to the <strong>TabControl</strong> region.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0pt -0.6pt\"><em><span style=\"color:#1f497d\" lang=EN-US><span style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:small\">&nbsp;</span></span></em></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0pt -0.6pt\"><span style=\"\" lang=EN-US><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\"><span style=\"font-size:small\">A possible option could be using the <strong>RegionContext</strong> as a communication mechanism between your regions.

    "Html": "<p>Hi Daniel,</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for the quick response - the issue is slightly different to what you are explaining.</p>\r\n<p>My Views are all registered using Region Discovery. The region they request to be showed in is contained on another View that is showed as a Scoped Region. The problem is that the Region Discovery is taking place _before_ the View which is Scoped is given its own Region Manager. i.e. Prism seems to load the View, spot the new Region, run the Region Discovery, give the discovered views a 'null' region manager before it gives the view that registered the Region it's own Region Manager. It looks like an issue which wouldn't exist had the DP's were inherited through the tree.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Graeme</p>",
