To make this option valid, you must initialize only one module per assembly.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, please take into account that once modules are loaded there is not way to unload them.</p>\r\n<p>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>",
