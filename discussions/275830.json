Display caption and display &quot;close&quot; button so user's can close tabs. TabItem being bound to my\r\n<strong>ViewModel</strong>. I added Button to my template and bound it to command. Command fires on my ViewModel. and.. Now what?!

It doesn't look good though. First of all, I'm using region navigation with\r\n<strong>RequestNavigate</strong>. So, I don't give my view <strong>Name</strong>. Second, I have multiple instances of the same\r\n<strong>View</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>The only way to handle this the way I see it&nbsp;- iterate through all instances of type of my\r\n<strong>View </strong>and then compare their's <strong>DataContext </strong>to my\r\n<strong>ViewModel </strong>(<strong>this</strong>)</p>\r\n<p>Does it sound right? I wonder if there any cleaner way.</p>\r\n",

This is achieved by implementing a custom <strong>RegionNavigationContentLoader </strong>class.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find it useful.</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a>ï»¿</p>",
