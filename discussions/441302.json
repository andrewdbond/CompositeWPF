On body load of this html page we are calling a method. Problem is this method is not getting called. \r<br />\n<br />\nIn our shell this view is not active. We are making this view active at a later point of time. and when that view is active after some point of time that Body onload method is getting called. I need the body onload to be called initially when that view's constructor is called on Application startup.\r<br />\n<br />\nPlease help..<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm not aware of what &quot;browser control&quot; you are using, but based on your description, the HTML onload method of the &lt;body&gt; is triggered when the view containing the control is being shown. As far as I know, we cannot raise an HTML event from the application, but as a quick workaround you can try to trigger it by activating and deactivating the view at startup.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\n<br />\nDamian Cherubini\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a><br />\n",
