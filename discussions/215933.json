Here is what im all about:</p>\r\n<p>To simplify lets say my application has these 3 projects : My Shell, module1 and module2, my shell is a screen only with links to module1 and module2 witch loads as new pages. Module1 has a range of controls lets say from the Silverlight Toolkit, like graphs etc.. Module2 also has controls lets say from teleric.</p>\r\n<p>I have my application utilizing the &ldquo;Reduce XAP size by using application library caching&rdquo; so these controls gets cashed when the app first loads witch is great, my problem however is that all these controls loads when the <strong>shell</strong> loads because all the controls is referenced in the shell project otherwise the controls don&rsquo;t work in Module1 or Module2.</p>\r\n<p>My Question is: is there a way to load these controls(&ldquo;Assemblies&rdquo;) when Module1 or 2 is requested rather than when the shell loads, this will give the impression of a much faster application because then the shell has no controls to load.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for any insight.</p>",

I think that you would like to know that this concept is managed in Prism by loading modules on demand and it has a section in the documentation, so you can take a look <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649534.aspx\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p id=483ed150-7332-012d-c73e-1231390b9201>By the way, this topic was also treated in the following forum threads:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=203855\">Discover and load modules dynamically at runtime</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=49448\">User Defined Module Loading using Prism</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=53284\">OnDemand Loading</a> </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p id=483ef240-7332-012d-c73f-1231390b9201>Additionally, there is a modularity Quickstart. so you could check this <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648089.aspx\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p id=483f18f0-7332-012d-c740-1231390b9201>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=483f4110-7332-012d-c741-1231390b9201>Fernando Antivero <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>",
