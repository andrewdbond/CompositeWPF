It's just adding a reference to the dll, adding the resources with translations,\r\n and using it in XAML. It worked in 5 minutes. I can add multiple resources to individual modules; and it works fine in visual studio designer and blend. And, locale can be changed on the fly. Meets my requirements :)</p>\r\n",
