But if I create a new one and do the same thing, it doesnt behave correctly.</p>\r\n<p>It should show &quot;View from Module A Loaded&quot; -&gt; Module B initialized --&gt; View from Module B loaded.</p>\r\n<p>However I get&nbsp;&quot;View from Module A Loaded&quot; -&gt; Module B initialized --&gt; &quot;View from Module A Loaded&quot; &#43;&nbsp;View from Module B loaded.</p>\r\n<p>A pity I can't attach my solution here, does an expert know from top of the head what could have gone wrong? I went through every line of code and can't see it. Its very frustrating..</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Many Thanks,</p>\r\n",
