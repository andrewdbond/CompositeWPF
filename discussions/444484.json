Or Datagrid with data with double click capability.\r<br />\n<br />\nFor double click I may use a delegate command to navigate to the particualr item that was clicked. In which case I am using the IRegionManager to navigate to the page of choice and pass the parameter to the detail page to show the details.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs is this approach optimal to pass the IRegionManager throughout the application in the viewmodels?\r<br />\n<br />\nAny advise on improvements is appreciated.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n",
