Ive studied samples of interaction requests and how to separate visual and logical part of our popup child window mechanism\r\n but ive encountered a few problems. We had some main tab region and there were registered main views from each module. After some user input a popup window came out and user was able to setup some properties. My question is how can i use Microsoft.Practices.Prism.Interactivity.InteractionRequest\r\n for my custom popup ChildWindow so i can modify content of a childwindow in a runtime but this window must be closable from within content context. Next thing i need standard ValidationSummary and for example BusyIndicator as a standard predefined part of\r\n this ChildWindow UI but source of validation summary and busy indicator value must came from content assigned to a childwindow. ive made a few tweaks and its looks akward to me but they worked. -&gt;</p>\r\n<p>&lt;telerik:RadBusyIndicator IsBusy=&quot;{Binding Content.DataContext.IsBusy, ElementName=contentControl}&quot;&gt;</p>\r\n<p>As you can see IsBusy property is bound to Content and underlying DataContext which contain IsBusy property on contentControl object within this xaml :-) As ive stated before it seems little bit weird and i am looking for a better solution since i dont like\r\n ElementName or named controls within the xaml. Is there any other way how to do this?</p>\r\n<p>And another important things is if i close this popup child window and reopen it silverlight end up with error describing i am trying to add the same visual controls which exists somewhere else.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for any ideas and sorry for my bad english.</p>\r\n",
