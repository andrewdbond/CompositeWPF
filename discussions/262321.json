But I came across this documentation which clearly states in a note that \"Visual Studio 2010 Express Edition can be used to develop Prism applications using the Prism Library.\" Here is the link to msdn <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405471(PandP.40).aspx\" target=\"_blank\">\"Install System Requirements\"</a>. So, I guess I am missing out something else. My initial guess is that I am missing \"Project Linker 2.2\", but then how do I install the same.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>regards,</p>\r\n<p>Nirvan.</p>",
