In our design, there are two regions; for instance let's name them as Contoller and &nbsp;Editor. Controller contains buttons such as save, delete etc. And Editor contains text boxes that collects user\r\n inputs. As Silverlight default manner, TextBox updates its binding at focus change. However, in our case, once you click on Save button in Contoller region, TextBox, which is located Editor region, does not lost its focus which causes binding not to be updated.\r\n In our trials, we saw that, if you click in a TextBox located in Contoller region, Editor region losts focus.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Is there any solution for this problem, how can we detect this focus change between regions ?&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Regards,</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Şerif</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
