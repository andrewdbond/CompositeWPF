From the documentation:\r\n<em>&quot;It is important to note that Prism was designed so that you can use any of Prism's capabilities and design patterns individually, or all together, depending on your requirements and your application scenario. Prism was designed so that it could be incrementally\r\n adopted, allowing you to use the capabilities and design patterns that make sense for your particular application without requiring major structural changes.&quot;</em></p>\r\n<p>You could take a look into the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430857%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">\r\nBasic MVVM QuickStart</a> and <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430869%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">\r\nMVVM QuickStart</a>, in which there is a focus on Prism's MVVM guidance, without requiring to use MEF's composable parts.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>\r\n",
