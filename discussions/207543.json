Any advice would be much appreciated. Most importantly I'm looking for a method that would be compatible with future versions of prism.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Richard</p>",

I said <em>uses </em>because Prism&rsquo;s latest version only  provides a single implementation of an attached behavior, which is used  in Silverlight only and might not be included in a future version as SL4  does provide a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.primitives.buttonbase.command(VS.96).aspx\">Command</a> property in the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.primitives.buttonbase(VS.96).aspx\">ButtonBase</a> class. More on this <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/2009/12/07/will-silverlight-4-icommand-support-simplify-using-commands-in-prism/\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p id=9f73e9b0-249a-012d-2768-12313d013db1>As the attached behavior  approach is not tied to specific Prism features (there are a couple of  classes you can use to facilitate its implementation though), that approach is  probably a good one. Some time ago I created a <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/2009/08/13/c-code-snippet-to-create-commands-with-attached-behaviors-using-prism/\">code  snippet</a> that really speeds up the creation of this kind of  behaviors.</p>\r\n<p id=9f740f60-249a-012d-2769-12313d013db1>Please let  me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=9f742f30-249a-012d-276a-12313d013db1>Damian  Schenkelman    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>",
