Both viewModels get the information of the same model. Let's say view1 or viewModel1 change a value of the model and this value is needed for view2\r\n as well. How can I notify the view2 of the changes?</p>\r\n<p>I get two approaches to solve this problem:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Using eventAggregator (Used in the StockTrader_UI but in a slightly different scenario)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Implementing INotifyProperty on the model to notify the viewModels of the changes and finally notify the view.</p>\r\n<p>I don't really like this two approaches...I'm getting something wrong? it shouldn't be that hard to accomplish something like that, didn't it?</p>\r\n<p>Any suggestions will be greetly appreciated.</p>\r\n",
