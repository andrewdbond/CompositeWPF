After I close the childwindow, all succeeding calls to the same childwindow have problems binding between the countries combo and countries collection. I believe\r\n the problem lies in the single ChildWindow instance that is reused over again, which results resetting the combobox collection ItemsSource...&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How can I force the PCWAction to create a new CW instance on popup??</p>\r\n<p>Any useful ideas would be helpful, thanks!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>One possibility to achieve your desired scenario would be to extend the <strong>\r\nPopupChildWindowActionBase </strong>class to create a new child window each time the\r\n<strong>Invoke </strong>method is called. Another possibility would be to obtain a new instance of your View Model each time the ChildWindow is shown (in the\r\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.childwindow.onopened%28VS.95%29.aspx\">\r\nOnOpened</a> method). If you keep experiencing problems after applying one of the aforementioned possibilities, it would be helpful if you could provide us with more information about which kind of problems you're experiencing in the binding, or also a repro\r\n sample of your scenario.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>\r\n",
