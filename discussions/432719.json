However, you should test your apps on the Windows Phone 8 emulator or on a device to make sure the apps perform as expected.&quot;</em>\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\n<br />\nAgustin Adami\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a><br />\n",
