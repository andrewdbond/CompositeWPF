Because a View has no code in it, you probably want to declare the DP in the ViewModel.</p>\r\n<p>2. If you want to bind an element in the View to the DP, again you would put the DP in the ViewModel because the DP would be a binding source.</p>\r\n<p>You could also review the following to understand DP more:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms743643.aspx\">Binding Sources Overview</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms748857.aspx\">How to: Make Data Available for Binding in XAML</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms746695.aspx\">How to: Specify the Binding Source</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms742167.aspx\">How to: Bind the Properties of Two Controls</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms753358.aspx#backing_with_dp\">Custom Dependency Properties - When Should You Implement a Dependency Property?</a></p>\r\n<p>Good luck!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
