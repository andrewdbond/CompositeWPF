    "Html": "<p>Hi Tolga,</p>\r\n<p>The means of communication between modules are, less specifically, means to communicate between loosely coupled components, which include the shell.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, if your scenario requires communicating from your shell towards your modules, you could use the same means described in the Communication Chapter of the Prism MSDN documentation. For example, you could publish an event through the Event Aggregator in your Shell's ViewModel, and have a module subscribe to that event as with any other event.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
