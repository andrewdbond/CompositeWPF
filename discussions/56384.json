Run the application<br>2. Click on Menu #1<br>3. Select &quot;Customer Details&quot;<br>4. Click on &quot;Open Pupup&quot; button<br>5. Click on &quot;Open View 2&quot;&nbsp; (View2 will be opened)<br>6. Click on &quot;Customer Details&quot; tab<br>Observe: Tab will be automatically moved back to &quot;View2&quot;.<br><br>Note: It happens only when we are launching the VIew2 from Popup. If we move the command &quot; Command=&quot;{Binding LaunchView2Command}&quot;&quot; to button above Popup, it won't happen. Not sure whether there is any relationship between Popup and Dock or Popup and Prism.</p>",
