Command.Click should give you a parse error, because it was renamed to Click.Command.<br>\r\nPlease not that in drop 10 the DLLs are now stripped of the &quot;.Silverlight&quot; suffix, so it might be a reason why you may still have the old DLLs not overwritten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope this helps,<br>\r\nJulian Dominguez<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/jdominguez\">http://blogs.southworks.net/jdominguez</a>\r\n",
