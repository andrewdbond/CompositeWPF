A button on each view will navigate to the other view (and it will be replaced in the region).<br />\nThe first time i do this operation, the OnNavigatedTo will not get fired (but view is shown). If I then in this view navigate back to the original view, the OnNavigatedTo in that ViewModel will fire. And if I then try the first navigation again, that too will fire the OnNavigatedTo.<br />\n<br />\nCould you please show me what you did wrong first and how you fixed it?<br />\n(I should add that my code is in WPF).<br />\n(I know this is a long time ago, so I understand if you don't have that code..)<br />\n<br />\nGert<br />\n",
