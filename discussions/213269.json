I would  recommend creating a separate login module to manage this, and making that  module decide whether the other ones are going to be loaded or not (as explained  on <a href=\"View.aspx?ThreadId=83910\">this  thread</a>).</p>\r\n<p>On logout, you can have your login module publish an event through the  <strong>EventAggregator</strong>, so that each module (which should be  subscribed to that event) removes their views, services, and so forth.&nbsp;Take into  account that when&nbsp;you login after having logged out once, you will probably have  to indicate the modules that they have to load their components back.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful.</p>\r\n<p id=00f092e0-4cba-012d-0c51-12313b071d41>Guido Leandro Maliandi<br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
