If your shared types are based on interfaces and the modules only have dependence on the interface, you can factor out the interfaces into a separate assembly and share that instead. But inevitably there is a set of entities, enums, exceptions, etc. that need to get shared across modules, and the infrastructure library is the place we typically put those.\r\n",
