When I add the Composite library to our Subversion server, the RegionManager somehow &quot;breaks&quot; and any views associated with it cannot be viewed in design time. Let me explain the course of action we are taking with the Hello World example:<br>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Compile and Run the example to verify it works, and it works fine. </li>\r\n    <li>Add the example to subversion and commit it. </li>\r\n    <li>Let another download the example from subversion (We are using TortoiseSVN).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe example compiles well, but Shell.xaml cannot be viewed in design time. When trying to reload the designer an error is reported saying:<br>\r\n&quot;Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attachable property 'RegionName' was not found in type 'RegionManager'.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D:\\C#\\AVT\\HelloWorld\\trunk\\HelloWorldSample\\Shell.xaml&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HelloWorldSample&quot;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis might not be the right forum for this, but have any of you guys any idea what is wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/Kimmen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
