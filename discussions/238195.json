All works fine.</p>\r\n<p>But noticing a strange behavior. When I navigate away from a module (view) in my region it seems to be calling the Loaded event of the view in that region. It doesnt recreate it from just calls the Loaded event before calling the OnNavigated from. I have\r\n been trying the debug through the stack trace, but havent been able to figure out why this is happening.</p>\r\n<p>Even more strange is it happens only for the first view loaded into the region for the very first time. Thereafter its fine. That is</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Load <strong>ViewA</strong> in <strong>Region1</strong> </li><li><strong>ViewA Loaded</strong> called followed by <strong>OnNavigatedTo</strong>\r\n</li><li>Navigating to <strong>ViewB</strong> </li><li><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><em><strong>ViewA Loaded called again</strong></em></span>, followed by\r\n<strong>OnNavigatedFrom</strong> - <strong><em>undesired. not sure why Loaded is being called</em></strong>\r\n</li><li><strong>ViewB loaded</strong> called followed by <strong>OnNavigatedTo</strong>\r\n</li><li>Navigating to <strong>ViewC</strong> </li><li><strong>ViewB OnNavigatedFrom</strong> called </li><li><strong>ViewC Loaded</strong> called followed by <strong>OnNavigatedTo</strong>\r\n</li><li>Navigating to <strong>ViewA</strong> </li><li><strong>ViewC OnNavigatedFrom</strong> called </li><li><strong>ViewA Loaded</strong> called followed by <strong>OnNavigatedTo</strong>\r\n</li><li>Navigating to <strong>ViewD</strong> </li><li><strong><em><span style=\"color:#008000\">ViewA OnNavigatedFrom called </span></em>-\r\n<em>desired behavior</em></strong> </li></ul>\r\n<p>Any idea what could be happening?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
