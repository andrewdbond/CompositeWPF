Hence, you could use the same guidance provided on how to upgrade from Prism 2.x to any 4.x version. This can be found in the following\r\n section of the <strong>Prism </strong>documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430859%28v=pandp.40%29.aspx\">Appendix D: Upgrading from Previous Versions, Upgrading from Prism 2.x</a>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>I hope this helps,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br>\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>\r\n",
