    "Html": "<p>Hi Guido,</p>\r\n<p>thanks for your reply.</p>\r\n<p>Since its all the SAME view (just created several instances), I cannot simply call UnselectAll() on the view, because then NO item could be selected effectively (the item which really IS selected and should be shown as selected would also be unselected). So my problem is that I don't know how to identify the one view _instance_ on which the selection occured, and the other view _instances_ which should be unselected. Another thing to say is that I have injected the view instances programmatically (using a controller class and service locator). So I also don't know how much view instances are placed to the region at compile time.. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Any guess?</p>\r\n<p><br />Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Andreas</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi Andreas,</p>\r\n<p>In that case, you could store an identifier in the <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/247539\">ListView.Tag</a> property, and check if it matches before calling the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/es-es/library/system.windows.controls.listbox.unselectall.aspx\">UnselectAll</a> method.</p>\r\n<p>Another possibility would be to use the Event Aggregator's filter functionality to check for the <strong>Tag </strong>property or a property in the controller (you can read more about the event aggregator in <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921122%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">this chapter</a> from the Prism msdn documentation, as well as check the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921173%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">Event Aggregation QuickStart</a>). If you use the MVVM pattern, you could store a property in your ViewModel and bind the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/es-es/library/system.windows.controls.primitives.selector.selecteditem.aspx\">ListView.SelectedItem</a> property to it. That way, you could subscribe to the aforementioned event in your ViewModel and perform this interaction there.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
