BindingExpression:Path=SearchCommand; DataItem='MainWindowViewModel' (HashCode=22047425); target element is 'Button' (Name='Search');\r\n target property is 'Command' (type 'ICommand')</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>For some reason the command from the 'child' user-control tries to bind to the view-model in the main window's view model, because for some reason - the child user-control's view model is not instantiated.</p>\r\n<p>Why is this ?</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>Based on my understanding of your scenario, the reason of these error is that child elements automatically inherit the\r\n<strong>DataContext </strong>of their parent element. The data flows down the visual tree, unless you set their own\r\n<strong>DataContext </strong>which in your case seems to be failing. This is why the\r\n<strong>Binding </strong>searches in the &quot;<strong>MainWindowViewModel</strong>&quot;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegarding why your 'child' user-controls' view model is not being set, so far, I couldn't find the cause within the code snippets you provided.&nbsp; It would be helpful to know how your child user-controls are being instantiated, note that in order to have\r\n their dependencies resolved you will have to resolve them through the container.</p>\r\n<p>Also, you could try adding the <strong>Public </strong>modifier to your <strong>\r\nViewModel </strong>property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br>\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>\r\n",
