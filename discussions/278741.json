    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>We tried to reproduce the error that you are describing by updating various QuickStarts included in the Prism guidance to the <strong>Unity 2.1.505.0 version</strong> using the <strong>NuGet manager</strong>, but we couldn&rsquo;t reproduce your problem (all the QuickStarts worked properly). We tried this using both <strong>.NET Framework 4</strong> and <strong>.NET Framework 4 Client Profile</strong> in the QuickStarts' projects when applicable, but it worked appropriately as well.</p>\n<p>Also, we updated the Prism library to the <strong>Unity 2.1.505.0 version</strong>, ran its tests and found that they all pass. It seems that your problem might be caused by a missing reference.</p>\n<p>You can find a version of the <strong>Modularity QuickStart with Unity</strong> using the <strong>Unity 2.1.505.0 version</strong> in this <a href=\"https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=7890102b5b8bc928&amp;sc=documents&amp;uc=1&amp;id=7890102B5B8BC928%21103\"> SkyDrive account</a> (under the name <strong>ModularityWithUnity2-1-5.zip</strong>). This sample might be useful for you to compare your solution to it, so as to find possible differences that might be causing the exception you mentioned.</p>\n<p>If this does not help you solve your problem, it would be helpful if you could provide us with a repro sample application, so we can help you troubleshoot it.</p>\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi&nbsp;<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for reply.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, the matter was in assembly reference. For some reason when Nuget manager updated the Unity assembly, the reference to ServiceLocation was gone from the project... magic.</p>\r\n<p>I thint the reason is somewhere inside the NUGet package, e.g it&nbsp;tries to set the ServiceLocation&nbsp;&nbsp;reference&nbsp;&nbsp;to new location (\\packages\\Unity.2.0\\lib\\SL30 vs&nbsp;\\packages\\Unity.2.1.505.0\\lib\\NET35) but the assembly itself was not included in the package.</p>\r\n<p>Or something like. Anyway, it's nothing to do with Prism :)</p>",
