    "Html": "Hi,<br />\n<br />\nBased on my understanding, I believe that a possible cause for this behavior could be that you are replacing the <strong>marriageStatusList</strong> property with a new collection in your <strong>client_getMarriageStatusCompleted</strong> event handler. Hence, as the the collection only notifies a change when an item is added, removed or when the collection is refreshed, which in this case is not happening, you may have to invoke the <strong>RaisePropertyChanged</strong> method on this property after changing its value in order to properly notify the UI about this change. For example, this could be achieved like this:<br />\n<pre><code> void client_getMarriageStatusCompleted(object sender, HappyNagarAppService.getMarriageStatusCompletedEventArgs e)\n    {\n marriageStatusList = e.Result;\n this.RaisePropertyChanged(() =&gt; this.marriageStatusList);\n    }</code></pre>\n\nI hope this helps,<br />\n<br />\nAgustin Adami<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a><br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi,<br />\n<br />\nSo far based on the code snippets you provided I couldn't find the reason for this behavior, in my case I haven't experimented with this particular control, but as a starting point, I believe you could check if your view's <strong>datacontext</strong> is being correctly set with the corresponding view model. Also, you could debug you application to see if the data is being correctly retrieved and set in your <strong>marriageStatusList</strong> property, take into account that as far as I know the collection retrieved from your service should be wrapped in a <strong>ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;</strong> instance, for example using one of its constructors that take an <strong>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</strong> or <strong>List&lt;T&gt;</strong> parameter:<br />\n<pre><code>myProperty = new ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;(Service.GetItemsList() );</code></pre>\n\nAdditionally, I believe you could check the following article from the <strong>Telerik</strong> site where a possible approach to Binding to WCF Service using the MVVM Approach is explained:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.telerik.com/help/silverlight/radcombobox-populating-with-data-binding-to-wcf.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">RadControls for Silverlight, Binding to WCF Service</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nI hope you find this handy,<br />\n<br />\nAgustin Adami<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a><br />\n",
