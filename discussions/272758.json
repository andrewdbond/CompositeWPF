    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>Based on my understanding you might find the region popup behaviours useful for your scenario. These behaviors allow you to define a <strong>Popup Region</strong>, which is a region that shows its active view as a popup. Therefore, once you define that region, you only need to add a view to that region in order for it to be shown in the popup. Note that this view can implement its own behavior, have its own view model, and so forth; so you can process the data introduced in that view in the way that better suits your requirements and preferences (through a shared service, event aggregator, etc.)</p>\r\n<p>You can find an a example of the usage of the <strong>Popup Region</strong> in the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921074%28v=PandP.40%29.aspx\">StockTrader RI</a>,which implements this approach to show the <strong>NewsReader Article </strong>as a popup window.<br /><br />Particularly you might take a look at the following code files:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>StockTraderRI_Desktop</strong>\\StockTraderRI.Infrastructure\\Behaviors\\<strong>RegionPopupBehavior.cs</strong></li>\r\n<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>StockTraderRI</strong>\\StockTraderRI.Infrastructure\\Behaviors\\<strong>PopupDialogActivationBehavior.cs</strong></li>\r\n<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>StockTraderRI_Desktop</strong>\\StockTraderRI.Infrastructure\\Behaviors\\<strong>WindowsDialogActivationBehavior.cs</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Also you can check how this region is define in the shell, in the following code snippet:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\r\n<pre>xmlns:infBehaviors=\"clr-namespace:StockTraderRI.Infrastructure.Behaviors;assembly=StockTraderRI.Infrastructure\"\r\ninfBehaviors:RegionPopupBehaviors.CreatePopupRegionWithName=\"SecondaryRegion\"\r\ninfBehaviors:RegionPopupBehaviors.ContainerWindowStyle=\"{StaticResource PopupStyle}\" \r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>",
