    "Html": "&gt;&gt;more than one page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can check how to use Region Manager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;&gt;- handling transaction on data commit from multiply views on the same page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can use Event Aggregator to notify the &quot;Save Command&quot; or maybe, you can try the Global Command too. But in our cases, we used to use Event Aggregator only ..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;&gt;- Guidens on navigation and how to set up a menu in Prism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou will need a third-part menu control if you want to have a menu in your Silverlight Prism project.. We are currently using Telerik Silverlight Menu with Prism vs2 and it's working great..&nbsp; Again, if you have good understanding about Region then you should be able to do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;&gt;I am working in a team that has just started building a very large\r\nSilverlight application and we really need some guidens on how to build\r\nthe infra structure of the application.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are actively using Prism v2 in our real project since drop 5. We are going to release our project around Feb. I hope that Prism v2 will be released at this time. I'm not sure what kinda guidence you need to build the infrastructure. You just need to put everything that you want to share within modules in infrastruture. For example: RegionName (MainRegion or Menu Region or etc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
