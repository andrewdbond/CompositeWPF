    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>There is not guidance for this topic in Prism out-of-the-box. But if your  application do not rely the printing capabilities on the print options of the  browser, you could take a look at the following documentation section on  MSDN:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee671023(VS.95).aspx\">Printing</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I think that it might be achieved from the Shell windows. Therefore, you  could pass the UserControl (shell) as UIElement, since it has the main region  that contains all views.</p>\r\n<p>Is there any reason because you are trying to print each view separately?</p>\r\n<p>I hope this helps,</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero<br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>",
