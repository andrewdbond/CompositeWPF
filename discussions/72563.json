In short, distributed application (parts of server, parts on clients) should behave like one big app. Its only a side project in a very early stage, but perhaps somebody did something similar already. If yes, a short note would be nice, no need to reinvent the wheel.</p>\r\n<p>The whole &quot;approach&quot; is described here (rough draft, thinking about creating a codeplex project)..</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1591829/prism-and-wcf-do-they-play-nice\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1591829/prism-and-wcf-do-they-play-nice</a></p>\r\n<p>Chris</p>\r\n<p>PS: If there are plans to do something similar by the &quot;pros&quot;, let me know. Would be a shame if I work on it for a few weeks, and then you release a new drop including some WCF features :-)</p>",
