    "Html": "<p>Hi Satch,</p>\r\n<p>There is not guidance on <strong>.NET Remoting</strong> for WPF in Prism out-of-the-box. But I think that you can check the following MSDN documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/72x4h507.aspx\">.NET Remoting</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Take into account that Microsoft is not recommending the use of <strong>.NET</strong> <strong>Remoting</strong> for new developments. <strong>Windows Communication Foundation</strong> (WCF) should be used for creating distributed applications. You can read more about <strong>WCF</strong> in the following articles:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms735119%28v=vs.90%29.aspx\">Windows Communication Foundation</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324\">WCF in .NET Framework Developer Center</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Additionally, if you decide to go with <strong>.NET Remoting</strong> approach you might obtain better support in the <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en/wpf/threads/\">WPF Forums</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Miguel Bronzovic<br /><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic\">http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
