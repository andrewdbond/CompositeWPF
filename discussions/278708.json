    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>When using Discovering Modules in a Directory approach, the module catalog will scan the specified folder and search for assemblies that define the modules for your application.</p>\n<p>In your case this error is shown because the directory you define:<strong> .\\Modules</strong> does not exist. A possible solution to avoid this could be by using <strong>Post-build events</strong> configured on your modules project to automatically store the modules assemblies in this folder after a succesful build.</p>\n<p>You might find an example of this on modules B and D of the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921068%28v=PandP.40%29.aspx#sec2\"> Modularity QuickStart</a>.</p>\n<p>Also we found that you could remove the <strong>StartupUri=\"MainWindow.xaml\"</strong> property in your <strong>App.xaml</strong> file as the bootstrapper should be the responsible for the initialization of the application.</p>\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a>ï»¿</p>",
