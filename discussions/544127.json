    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nFirst of all, I would like to mention that Apps of <strong>Windows Store</strong> use another Prism project known as <strong>Prism for Windows Runtime</strong>. Therefore, questions for <strong>Windows Store Apps</strong> with <strong>Prism</strong> have their own forum site in order to keep track of them. The following <strong>Codeplex</strong> site corresponds to <strong>Prism for Windows Runtime</strong>:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://prismwindowsruntime.codeplex.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prism for Windows Runtime</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nAnyway, the error may be ocurring when assigning the value to the parameter variable. I would suggest you to raise the <strong><em>PropertyEventChanged</em></strong> event directly from the Property's set block statement, rigth after setting the value to the _<strong><em>playingSong</em></strong> variable as shown in the second code block.\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope this helped you,\r<br />\nRegards.\r<br />\n<br />\nGabriel Ostrowsky\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky</a><br />\n",
