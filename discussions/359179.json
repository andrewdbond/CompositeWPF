    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>If I am not mistaken, the Mark Miller's articles you are mentioning seem to be targeting <strong>Prism v2</strong> or a previous version. In <strong>Prism v4</strong> the namespaces were changed from <strong>Microsoft.Practices.Composite</strong> to <strong>Microsoft.Practices.Prism</strong> and the <strong>GetModuleCatalog </strong>method of the <strong>Bootstrapper </strong>was renamed to <strong>CreateModuleCatalog</strong>. You can find a complete list of the differences between <strong>Prism v4</strong> and previous versions in the following section of the <strong>Prism </strong>documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430871%28v=pandp.40%29\">What's New in Prism 4.0</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Regarding <strong>Prism v4 </strong>and <strong>MVVM </strong>I believe you could find the following chapters of the <strong>Prism </strong>documentation useful, which focus mainly on the implementation of the <strong>MVVM </strong>pattern in <strong>Prism</strong>, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">without</span> mentioning the UI Compositions capabilities provided by <strong>Prism </strong>(regions, navigation, etc):</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405484%28v=pandp.40%29\">Chapter 5: Implementing the MVVM Pattern</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405494%28v=pandp.40%29\">Chapter 6: Advanced MVVM Scenarios</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
