For some reason I am getting errors and can not get a Ribbon namespace in C# classes.  I've downloaded and installed &quot;Microsoft Ribbon for WPF October 2010&quot; but it didn't help.\r<br />\n<br />\nCan anyone suggest please how to get Ribbon Libraries in my WPF Prism project ?\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you <br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi,<br />\n<br />\nIn order to be able to use <strong>Ribbon</strong> on <strong>Visual Studio 2012</strong> and <strong>WPF</strong>, you will first need to download and install <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11877\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft Ribbon for WPF October 2010</a> like you already did. Then, you first need to reference the <strong>RibbonControlsLibrary</strong> assembly located in the installation folder from your project. Finally, to use it in XAML or code behind you will need to refer to the <strong>Microsoft.Windows.Controls.Ribbon</strong>, like the following:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>XAML</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\nxmlns=&quot;clr-namespace:Microsoft.Windows.Controls.Ribbon;assembly=RibbonControlsLibrary&quot;\r\n</pre></div><ul>\n<li><strong>C#</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:Blue;\">using</span> Microsoft.Windows.Controls.Ribbon;\r\n</pre></div>Hope this helps,<br />\n<br />\nFederico Martinez <br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez</a> <br />\n",

    "Html": "Thank you for your reply Federico,\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I run &quot;Microsoft Ribbon for WPF Source and Samples&quot; Windows Installer Package, it seems that installs it but I can't find where.  So no files or assemblies are created.  And no namespace for &quot;Microsoft.Windows.Controls.Ribbon&quot; can be resolved within VS2012.  I don't know whether this has to do with x64 platform.\r<br />\n<br />\nI also read on another forum that Ribbon should be in VS2012 with .Net 4.5 framework and no additional installation needed.  But either way I still can't get it work.<br />\n",

Nevertheless, I found that the default install location where you can find the <strong>RibbonControlLibrary.dll</strong>  assembly should be one of the following depending on your operating system platform:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For <strong>x86</strong> systems:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\nC:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Ribbon for WPF\\V4.0<br />\n</blockquote>\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>For <strong>x64</strong> systems:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Ribbon for WPF\\V4.0<br />\n</blockquote>\n<h1></h1>\nHope this helps,\r<br />\n<br />\nFederico Martinez \r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez</a> <br />\n",

    "Html": "Thanks Federico, that's correct.  I found it there.  I also realised that I could include from the project example that I am using it.  I still don't understand, the  RibbonControlsLibrary.dll&quot; library is for 3.5 or 4.0 .net frameworks which were offered by Microsoft in October 2010.  That this mean that VS2012 and .Net 4.5 should include the Ribbon by default and we should have WPF Ribbon Project Templates available in VS2012 ?<br />\n",
