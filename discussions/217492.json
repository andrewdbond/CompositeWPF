But once modules have been loaded it is not possible to unload/reload them. For more information, you can take a look at <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=203855\">this forum thread</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p id=fcb015c0-6520-012d-8279-12313b06d961>That said, I think that a possible approach for your requirement is to manipulate views at runtime. Using the RegionManager you can add, remove, active, etc views from regions. For more information you could check &ldquo;view discovery&rdquo; <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648265.aspx\">here</a>.&nbsp; If you consider View Discovery useful for your application you could check the UIComposition quickstart <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff647276.aspx\">here</a> or you can download a more advanced sample from <a href=\"http://cid-60a74023ee1812bd.office.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/ViewDiscoverySample.zip\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p id=fcb02e10-6520-012d-827a-12313b06d961>Additionally, assuming that your ribbon is on a separated module, you could consider to use <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649187.aspx\">Event Aggregation</a> for the communication between the modules. Also this is something demonstrated in the View Discovery advanced sample.</p>\r\n<p id=fcb04ec0-6520-012d-827b-12313b06d961>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=fcb06f10-6520-012d-827c-12313b06d961>Fernando Antivero <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>",
