I have an RasterItemModule which contains view, services, presentationModel etc for converting and loading images into viewer. I also have a CarouselModule which contains the CarouselView - this consists of CarouselItemsControl which I presume is of type ItemsControl. What I cannot work out is how to get the RasterItem views  into the carousel view ie where would I put the region name for each item view? Also - I assume I will need to create a scoped region for every image pulled off the server and use something like the filename to name each region? Lastly - is a controller the best place to do all this view injection?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks in advance<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKern<br>\r\n",

These will be the class that will know how to retrieve images from the server and create RasterItem view, so once it's done it can inject that view into the corresponding region. You might find usefull the </span><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc707883.aspx\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">UI Composition</span></a><span style=\"font-family:calibri\"> design concept from the documentation.</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\"> \r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">I think that it won't be necessary to create scoped regions for each image. In general the RegionManager acts as a locator, used by external modules to be able to find UI containers defined on other modules in a loosely coupled way (in this case RasterItem module will locate the Carousel region to inject each image).  So, unless other modules need to find images and use them as container for other views, you don't have to associate a region for each image. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'courier new'\"> </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'courier new'\"> </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">Hope it helps!</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\"> </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">Matias Bonaventura</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\"><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;font-family:calibri\">http://blogs.southworks.net/matiasb</span></a> </p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\"> </span></p>\r\n</span></p>\r\n",
