If you want to create a new container, you  could write something like:</p>\r\n<p id=6f66ccd0-4722-012d-a532-123139097e21><span style=\"font-family:Consolas;font-size:small\">\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>IUnityContainer container = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> UnityContainer();\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p id=6f66da40-4722-012d-a533-123139097e21>but not:</p>\r\n<p id=6f66e5a0-4722-012d-a534-123139097e21><span style=\"font-family:Consolas;font-size:small\">\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>IUnityContainer container = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> IUnityContainer();\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p id=6f66f390-4722-012d-a535-123139097e21>As for the reference, in every  project that you use the Unity Container, whether it is the shell or a module,  you must add a reference to the <strong>Microsoft.Practices.Unity </strong>assembly. You can find that assembly in the LIB folder that comes with  Prism. Inside the StockTrader RI, there are&nbsp;references to it in the shell and  all&nbsp;its modules.</p>\r\n<p id=6f6705d0-4722-012d-a536-123139097e21>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p id=6f671820-4722-012d-a537-123139097e21>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",

    "Html": "<p>Thanks Guido, however I did not solve the problem that way and it looks the instantiate interface error came from the previous error where it was always telling me to add 1.2 reference, once I did download and installed the 1.2 version and referened in my project, no more errors but now another&nbsp;error I don't remember poped up&nbsp;while loading the first module.</p>\r\n<p>As a final measure, what I did was to copy all the CAL projects altogether to my solution (like it is with the StockTrader app) and magic happens using the unity 2.0 and these projects references instead of the dlls I got to run my project just fine, I don't know if someone else could confirm that using the dlls causes somewhow my errors and the workaround is to add the CAL projects references directly?</p>\r\n<p>thanks</p>",
