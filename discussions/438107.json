    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nBased on my understanding on your scenario, there is no need for you to use scoped regions in this case, as you can show multiple instances of a view using any of the approaches that are mentioned in the following chapters of Prism documentation:<br />\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921098(v=pandp.40).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chapter 7: Composing the User Interface</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430861(v=pandp.40).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chapter 8: Navigation</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nIf you are experiencing any issue with this, it would be helpful if you can provide us with more information about what problem you are experiencing.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\n<br />\nFederico Martinez \r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez</a><br />\n",
