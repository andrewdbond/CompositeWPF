Where my problems is lies with&nbsp;separation&nbsp;of concerns. My subset of controls could easily make use of a ViewModel entirely\r\n unto itself. The questions is when does a UserControl become a View? If the UserControl should be a View, how do I share state from the View with its parent View? Is the simple MVVM RI (which works well for straight forward utility apps) not enough to support\r\n a composite view scenario? Thanks!</p>\r\n",
