And so on IsNavigationTarget method it cannot compare if it is the correct viewmodel and so tries to open up a new one. As in some views they are editing records, so it always brings the same one back if they are editing that one.<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi James,\r<br />\n<br />\nThe next drop of Prism has this issue addressed, as navigation parameters are saved in the Navigation Journal. However, as a very easy workaround for now, you could use the old approach of passing query string parameters, since you just needs an int to be passed, in the following way.\r<br />\n<br />\nvar params = new NavigationParameters(); \r<br />\nparams.Add(&quot;SomeId&quot;, _someId); //As an int or string\r<br />\nregionmanager.RequestNavigate(&quot;SomeRegion&quot;, &quot;SomeView&quot; + params.ToString());\r<br />\n<br />\nThis is the old way of doing it and it is still supported in Prism, but now the UriQuery class is renamed to NavigationParameters, maintaining the old functionality and adding support for object parameters.\r<br />\n<br />\nHope this helps,\r<br />\nDiego Poza<br />\n",
