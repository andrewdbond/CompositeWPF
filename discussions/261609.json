RIght now, silverlight 6 will be started asp.net mvc will be doing improvements along with asp.net I am not telling you that someday html5 may take over however it's at least 5 years before we should be even talking\r\n about this.

While WPF and Silverlight's long term roadmap is in doubt, I believe it is time to start the conversation of what\r\n PRISM is in a windows 8 and beyond world, from a near term and a long term persepctive.

Of course some unknowns are part of the business, but having a partner that is willing to be in\r\n it for the long haul enables us to work through the unknowns. The secrecy of MS in this case put that partnership in serious doubts at all levels of mgmt within many organization. I now have to figure out how to rebuild that confidence to both save my career\r\n and to help insure that MS has a seat at the table when application technology solutions are considered.\r\n<br>\r\nIf there is a //Build/ session that I should watch to get the start of these answers, can you point me to it?

But if we talk about LOB applications I think the focus should also be on corporate apps for side loading in a company.</p>\r\n<p>As a Silverlight developer of a really big (energy) company (160.000 employees) I&rsquo;m not allowed to use MVVM frameworks like MVVM light, developed by a single person.</p>\r\n<p>We try to build maintainable, evolvable and testable application</p>\r\n<p>In fact of this we are developing modular intranet applications (Silverlight/ PRISM, Unity, WCF, EF, SQL Server). We are still developing with Windows XP and switch next year to Win 7 (!). Big companies are always 5 years back in the past. So Silverlight will be still alive for us until the end of&nbsp;live cycle of Win 7.</p>\r\n<p>But never the less being part of a think tank within the company, we think about developing apps for Windows 8, - but not for the app store. We are thinking about multi target applications: Desktop, tablet, phone. One code, multiple targets, switching only the view. Yeah, that&rsquo;s MVVM. This was possible for WPF/Silverlight and WP7. But what about WinRT?</p>\r\n<p>If you think about Windows 8 LOB, you will also have to think about maintainable, evolvable and testable applications. Silverlight and WPF never supported totally the MVVM pattern, so you guys developed PRISM (and all the other MVPs created little but nice forks). At the beginning this was not easy but with Silverlight 3 behaviors were introduced so that you could also implement the EventToCommand pattern to avoid code behind and to develop fine decoupled applications.</p>\r\n<p>But WinRT doesn&rsquo;t support behaviors and also the binding functionality has been reduced. Bing maps for example have no really bindings anymore.</p>\r\n<p>Do you think it is possible to develop high quality WinRT LOB apps on the same level like today with Silverlight or WPF?</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll look forward what you guys will create and I&rsquo;m happy that you are still alive.<br /><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\" lang=\"EN-US\">Regards<br />Dirk<br />PS: If you need persons involved deeply in MVVM, PRISM and Unity for brainstomring from outside MSFT don't hesitate to contact me (and certainly also the other member of this forum)</span></p>",

It is important to realize though that if you intend to make it a WinRT app, you are at a minimum constrained by the intentional limitations of the platform\r\n (the sandbox that WinRT apps run in) and you should be constrained some by the &quot;Modern UI Style&quot; (aka Metro-style) that guides you to building a much smaller scale and simpler app than many LOB desktop apps have been in the past. If you need to live outside\r\n those constraints, then building a desktop app is still the right thing to do, especially if you have the requirement to run on older platforms than Windows 8. Just because we have a new way of building client applications doesn't mean that all client applications\r\n should be built in this environment.</p>\r\n<p>My 2c.</p>\r\n<p>Brian</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi Pmont,&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A lot of comment on there!</p>\r\n<p>As far as building an app that you expect to live for 5, 10, 20 years... depends on what you mean by &quot;live&quot;. Seems like many people discussing this in the context of modern UI technologies are treating it as if a technology is &quot;dead&quot; as soon as the last\r\n planned version of it ships. Silverlight is not dead, there are just no planned future versions that anyone knows about at this point. It is still just as viable to build a new Silverlight app today as it was before Silverlight 5 shipped. Just as it is still\r\n viable to build a new Windows Forms app today as long as you understand you are not going to get any new features. I think it is reasonable to expect a 5-10 year lifetime out of any of the current UI technology choices. I think it may be naive to expect much\r\n beyond that without some degree of rewrite - if not for technology sake, for your user's sake. Can anyone really say that their current business model and use cases will be mostly the same more than a decade from now? I doubt it.</p>\r\n<p>But it is the world we are living in now - we want rapid innovation from the software platforms, but we somehow want it to be stable and unchanging for the long term. That is just an unsolvable conundrum in my book.</p>\r\n<p>I agree with your perspective on what a LOB app is - to me it is any app built by a business to support what they do as a business, regardless of whether it is consumer facing or for internal employees. But the latter case aligns a little better with the\r\n traditional concept of LOB.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Your point on the growing expectations of users is I think the most important one of why we think LOB guidance for WinRT is needed now. People will want the same fast and fluid experience for their business apps, especially if given touch devices or screens,\r\n and they are only going to get that from a Windows Store app. But the simple fact is WinRT at this point in time has not matured to address the full range of business needs that go outside of the sandbox. Microsoft has said very clearly that Windows 8 is a\r\n consumer focused release. I think they will get to those things in future releases/OS's, but there is nothing p&p can do to show how to make the platform do something it was specifically designed not to do.</p>\r\n<p>So the Kona project that is focused on LOB guidance for Windows Store apps is really focused on trying to show how you can eek out as good of a business app as possible based on what the platform currently supports, particularly how to structure it for longer\r\n term maintainability and testability, and not so much on how to go outside the bounds of what WinRT says you can do.</p>\r\n<p>p&p's job (my words, not theirs) is to provide guidance on how to best use the current platforms, not how to hack them into doing things they are not designed to do. If you don't like the design, you need to try to get that feedback heard by the product\r\n teams that produce that platform (Windows Division in this case), for which the Connect site is unfortunately one of the only paths to doing so at this point.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I too sincerely hope Windows Division will open up a bit and operate more like DevDiv and the Windows Azure and ASP.NET teams in particular currently do. But neither I nor p&p have much if any sway in making that happen.</p>\r\n",
