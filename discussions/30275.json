When using the ReflectionOnly APIs, dependent assemblies must be pre-loaded or loaded on demand through the ReflectionOnlyAssemblyResolve event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I add a reference inside the main assembly it loads fine and functions as I would expect.&nbsp; I'm sure this is an easy resolution to this but I must be missing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Justin\r\n",
