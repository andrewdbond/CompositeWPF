If you don't wish to modify the Prism Library to achieve this, you can create a custom implementation of the <strong>IEventAggregator </strong>class which contains this logic by default.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
