There are 2 ways I can see to get text on to my buttons, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The Module itself can interact with an interface level Service to add the button to the toolbar (very similar to they way UIExtension sites work in CAB/SCSF) OR<br>\r\n2. I can add something a string to the IModule interface so that the shell can interrogate the module for it's &quot;display name&quot; to go on the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think both have their merits and I was wondering what the consensus was on which way is &quot;better&quot;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone care to share their thoughts on this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
