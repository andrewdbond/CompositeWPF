    "Html": "<p>Hi Waleed,</p>\r\n<p>Based on the description of your scenario, in my opinion you should try to keep the separation of concerns of your modular application by leaving the menu module in charge of showing the menu, and related responsibilities, and not make it responsible of authorization of the users. What you should do is to create a module for authentication and authorization. This module will have the responsibility of letting you visit the requested view or simply redirecting to an information view showing a forbidden message.</p>\r\n<p>Take into account that the rest of your application should be agnostic about your authentication and authorization process.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this opinion useful.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Miguel Bronzovic<br /><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic\">http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
