Is it best practice to place specific concrete model types to the infrastructure project? I thought\r\n that there should only be interfaces placed..&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Best regards</p>\r\n<p>Andreas</p>\r\n",

As you mentioned, these interfaces needs to be implemented on their Modules,\r\n in order to build a loosely coupled application.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Miguel Bronzovic<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic\">http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
