    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>As far as I know, there is no official guidance in Prism for .<strong>NET Framework 4.5</strong>, <strong>.NET Metro Style</strong> applications or <strong>Visual Studio 11</strong> beta. So far, the latest version of Prism (version 4.1) was build to target&nbsp; <strong>.NET Framework 4.0</strong> and <strong>Silverlight 5</strong>; therefore, it would be possible to experience unexpected behaviors or incompatibility issues if you are using it against <strong>.NET Framework 4.5</strong>. However, you can try rebuilding the Prism library's source code for desktop (which you can find shipped with the latest release) to target the <strong>.NET Framework 4.5</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Prism provides three different versions of it's Prism library: for Desktop (<strong>.NET Framework 4.0</strong>), for <strong>Silverlight 5</strong> and for <strong>Windows Phone 7</strong>. As far as I know, each one is designed to take advantage of the capabilities of the specific platform they are targeting; therefore, the <strong>.NET Framework</strong> version wouldn't work with <strong>Silverlight</strong> or <strong>Windows Phone 7</strong> an so on.</p>\r\n<p>Based on my understanding, a <strong>Portable Class Library</strong> project allows to write code that can work in more than one platform. As the Prism library has different versions for each platform, it seems that this scenario is not supported as out of the box. For example, if your <strong>Portable Class Library</strong> targets both <strong>.NET Framework</strong> and <strong>Silverlight </strong>and you reference the desktop version of the Prism library, the <strong>Portable Class Library</strong> might work correctly when running in desktop but might fail in <strong>Silverlight</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Also, according to the following article, the assemblies that figure in the errors you are mentioning are not supported when targeting a <strong>.NET Framework</strong> platform:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg597391.aspx\">Portable Class Library article on MSDN - Supporting the View Model Pattern</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
