Does anyone feel that I should lower my expectations when ideas like dependency injection are in play? I remember seeing early Acropolis demos&nbsp;that showed designer support and thought&nbsp;that it was a good direction.&nbsp;To some degree,&nbsp;I think that folks (archs, designers etc) can work within a narrow view of the app and let it be assembled in its final form at runtime&nbsp;but I would like to&nbsp;be able to visualize the relationships between things&nbsp;without digging through source. &nbsp;Can&nbsp;tools evolve to deal with this or are we simply choosing loose coupling over the ability to understand our applications as they grow large and begin to spread their wings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n",
