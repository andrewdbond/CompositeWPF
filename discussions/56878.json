My solution has a ApplicationRegion where I will host different features of the application. But now my client insists on using a tabed interface.</p>\r\n<p>So my question is: How do I combine a tabular interface with Regions? Do I fake the tabs and still use one region for the application or do I place one region in each tab?</p>\r\n<p>Regards Bj&ouml;rn Eriksen</p>",
