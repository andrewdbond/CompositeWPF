I have multiple buttons on the right side of the window and a some view shown on my left side empty space.</p>\r\n<p>Looks like as I need to change my view based on the buttons clicked, I need to have use concept for Regions used in a dialog. So when I click a button, a new view is going to be loaded, for another button, another view would be loaded.</p>\r\n<p>Do you guys think this is a good approach? Any pointers are appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Indrasis</p>\r\n",
