    "Html": "<p>Hi Marcus,</p>\r\n<p>I use the activity control for a module loading wait screen, but its not really any more sophisticated than what you described you did. I put an activity control in the shell around my main region (to which most modules are loaded) and tied the IsActive property to a property tied to the loading status of modules in the region. Per some other logic in my project I have to publish module start load and module finish load events through the aggregator anyway so I figured why not use them for that.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
