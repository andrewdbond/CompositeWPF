Currently we are faced with a screen resize issue for all WPF windows that contain a DeckWorkspace. Grabbing the bottom/top window edges and dragging them seems to re-render the screen but the screen does not resize. Grabbing the left/right/corner window edges resizes the screen, but not proportionally.$0$0Are there any outstanding issues related to this?$0$0Thanks in advance for your help.</span>$0<span style=\"color:rgb(8, 8, 8);font-family:Verdana;font-size:13px\">$0</span>$0$0<span style=\"color:rgb(8, 8, 8);font-family:Verdana;font-size:13px\">Todd</span>$0",
