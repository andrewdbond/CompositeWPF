Which will allow you to consume this classes from different projects without knowing their specific implementation.</p>\r\n<p>For more information about the use of dependency injection containers you could check the following chapter of the <strong>Prism </strong>documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921140%28v=pandp.40%29.aspx\">Chapter 3: Managing Dependencies Between Components</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I hope you find this handy,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>",
