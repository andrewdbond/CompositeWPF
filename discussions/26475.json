But, you are binding to DataContext, i, and i think many others as well have a different problem.....<br />I would like to show selection list's in any of the TapPages.<br />So, the user selects Customers in an menu so i have to show a listview to select customers. While binding the header to DataContext give some problems. Did you have an generic way to bind the HeaderInfo and a list????<br /><br />thanks<br />Peter<br />",
