    "Html": "Hi Deepak,\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you define your <strong>TabControl</strong> as a region, then each view you inject in it will be represented as a new tab. So basically, when you click the Button to add a view, the corresponding Command would be executed in the corresponding view model, adding the view to the region; for example, doing something like this:<br />\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\n<span style=\"color:Blue;\">this</span>.regionManager.Regions[<span style=\"color:#A31515;\">&quot;TabRegion&quot;</span>].Add( viewA1 );\n<span style=\"color:Blue;\">this</span>.regionManager.Regions[<span style=\"color:#A31515;\">&quot;TabRegion&quot;</span>].Activate( viewA1 ); <span style=\"color:Green;\">// Optional, if you want to select the viewA1 as the active tab </span>\r\n</pre></div>The injected view should be automatically wrapped in a <strong>TabItem</strong> and added to the <strong>TabControl</strong>.\r<br />\n<br />\nPlease let us know if you have any doubts.\r<br />\n<br />\nDamian Cherubini\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a><br />\n",
