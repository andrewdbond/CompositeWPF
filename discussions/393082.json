    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi Rafael,</p>\r\n<p>I believe, one thing you could consider when using a <strong>DelegateCommand</strong>, is that when the\r\n<strong>CanExecute </strong>status changes, the view model can notify this change by calling the\r\n<strong>RaiseCanExecuteChanged </strong>method on the <strong>DelegateCommand </strong>\r\nobject. This causes the <strong>CanExecuteChanged </strong>event to be raised causing that any controls in the\r\n<strong>UI</strong> that are bound to the command will update their enabled status to reflect the availability of the bound command. Perhaps, this could be related to your behavior.</p>\r\n<p>You could find more information about the use of <strong>DelegateCommands </strong>\r\nand and how to associate them with controls in the view in the following section of the\r\n<strong>Prism </strong>documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405484%28v=pandp.40%29#sec10\">Chapter 5: Implementing the MVVM Pattern, Commands</a>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Also, for an example of how you can implement this, you might find the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921082%28v=pandp.40%29\">\r\nCommanding QuickStart</a> provided with <strong>Prism </strong>interesting.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br>\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>\r\n",
