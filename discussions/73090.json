This region contains data related to an object, which is selected in another region, let's call that one &quot;ListRegion&quot;. Depending on what type of object is selected in the &quot;ListRegion&quot;, a corresponding view will be loaded into the &quot;PropertiesRegion&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>My problem is that these different properties-views are vastly different and use different data-sources, so I have placed them in separate modules. How shall I inject the correct view into the &quot;PropertiesRegion&quot;? Clicks in the &quot;ListRegion&quot; generate an event I can subscribe to, but where should the injection take place? Should each module subscribe to this event, and inject itself if the object type corresponds to the type it is responsible for? Or is there another solution?</p>\r\n<p>Thankful for any assistance</p>\r\n<p>Kind Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Exipen</p>",
