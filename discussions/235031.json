That said, there is no guidance about how to mock the Application.Current in Prism out-of-the-box. I assume that you\r\n are trying to test the following method:</p>\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">protected override void </span>InitializeShell()<br>{<br>    <span style=\"color:blue\">base</span>.InitializeShell();<br><br><span style=\"color:blue\">#if </span>SILVERLIGHT<br>    <span style=\"color:gray\">Application.Current.RootVisual = (Shell)this.Shell;            <br></span><span style=\"color:blue\">#else<br>    </span>Application.Current.MainWindow = (Shell)<span style=\"color:blue\">this</span>.Shell;<br>    Application.Current.MainWindow.Show();<br><span style=\"color:blue\">#endif<br></span>}<br></pre>\r\n<p>In the Prism Library the <strong>base.InitializedShell</strong> method has already been tested. That said, I am not sure whether the override method in your Bootstrapper should be tested or not, as it contains reference to static classes. A possible solution\r\n for testing this could be create a CodeUI test.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding to test the registration of views in regions, it is something tested in the PrismLibrary, so this might be solved by creating a mock of the IRegionManager/IRegion. You can check similar tests on the StockTraderRI.</p>\r\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero <br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>\r\n",
