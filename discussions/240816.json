You could have your ViewModel obtain them through a reference to your view.</p>\r\n<p>However, take into account that it's not recommended for the ViewModel to be aware of the view, so the recommended practice would be to directly place those resources as properties in your ViewModel, and bind to them in your view.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>\r\n",
