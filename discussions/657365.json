I have set the PartCreationPolicy for both the view and the viewmodel to be NonShared. My viewmodel implements INavigationAware. I have a TabControlRegionAdapter defined as well.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever when I do a regionManager.RequestNavigate to the view it seems to create only 1 instance of the view and viewmodel. I'm not sure how I should get the view and viewmodel to create a new instance for every tab item I create. Any help here will be much appreciated.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm using Prism 4.1.0.0 with MEF.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks.\r<br />\n<br />\nGanesh<br />\n",
