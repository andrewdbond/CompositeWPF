The View/ViewModel being navigated to then implements INavigationAware and in the NavigatedTo (or IsNavigationTarget or NavigatedFrom) method you can extract the uri parameters from the NavigationContext object. I use this technique and it works well.</p>\r\n<p>There is more info on this technique in the Navigation chapter in the MSDN Prism documention. Take a look here <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430861(v=pandp.40).aspx\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430861(v=pandp.40).aspx</a>&nbsp;and look for the section titled <strong>Passing Parameters During Navigation.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>",
