    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>Based on my understanding of your scenario, you could subscribe to the <strong>completed  event</strong> for your save data async method, and make the call to the <strong>continuation  callback</strong> in the handler for this event. This way the navigation operation will  be pending until you have finished saving the data.</p>\r\n<p>We've created a  sample application that portrays this (based on the Prism Training Kit,  Navigation HOL, Exercise 3). In our sample, we have a <strong>sample database service</strong>,  which simulates a save operation. In the <strong>ConfirmNavigationRequest </strong>method, we  call the sample <strong>SaveDataAsync </strong>method instead of the <strong>continuation callback</strong>, and  in the handler of the <strong>SaveDataCompleted </strong>event, we do call the <strong>continuation  callback</strong> (which we previously stored).</p>\r\n<p>You can find the sample <a href=\"https://skydrive.live.com/?ppud=4#!/?cid=7890102b5b8bc928&amp;sc=documents&amp;uc=1&amp;id=7890102B5B8BC928!103\">in my Skydrive account</a>, under the&nbsp;<strong></strong> name <strong>ConfirmationCallbackSample</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Please let us know if we have  misunderstood your scenario.</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>",
