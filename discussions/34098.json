The default module would have previous connected to the successful logged in composite command or event. This way, on successful logged in the default module would know show itself.&nbsp; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnybody has a sample of their Authentication &amp; Authorization implementation?<br>\r\n",

Optionally you can enable a roles provider to expand the possibilities of the authorization of users in your application. Pretty cool stuff and if you know ASP.NET, you can use this pretty quick.<br>\r\n",
