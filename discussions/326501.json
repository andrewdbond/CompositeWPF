Also, in the <a href=\"../releases/view/55576\">Downloads</a> page you can find that no specific operating system is listed among the prerequisites list.</p>\r\n<p>If you wish to check Prism's source code in detail, you can find it included in the releases provided in the <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/releases/view/55576\">Downloads</a> page or you can obtain it from the <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets\">Source Code</a> page.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
