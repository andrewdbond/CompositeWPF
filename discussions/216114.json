Keep in mind I will most likely be coming back to the DataView shortly and I don't want to run through my DataView's InitializeComponent() again. Should I region.remove(DataView) and region.deactivate(DataView)? Or should I just deactivate?</p>\r\n<p>Sorry but I can't find any good explanation of the two in the documentation. Thanks in advance.</p>",
