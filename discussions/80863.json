I am comparing this adapter with the tabControl adapter that is much more faster. When I activate a&nbsp;view that is already loaded it seems to take sometimes 2 seconds to appear. The view is empty and there is no service called.</p>\r\n<p>I know that you can consider two seconds acceptable but if I have a contentcontrol and change its content the transition is immediate. Even with the supposed addtional work because of Prism I&nbsp;beleive that this is very high. For now I have only 4 Views I cannot imageine when other views were loaded.</p>\r\n<p>Besides that the TabControl is almost immediate.</p>\r\n<p>Whant can I do to make it faster ???</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>",
