So you could manage in this service all navigation errors.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, I think that you can find interesting the following post from the Karl Shifflett's Blog:\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kashiffl/archive/2010/10/05/integrating-prism-v4-region-navigation-with-silverlight-frame-navigation.aspx\">\r\nIntegrating Prism v4 Region Navigation with Silverlight Frame Navigation</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
