    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nBased on the code snippets you provided, we couldn't find anything wrong in your code. Therefore, we think that the problem could be related on the way you are subscribing and raising the property changed event on the <strong>ShowInd</strong> property. It would be helpful if you could provide us a code snippet showing this property logic so that we can analyze it in further detail.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nFederico Martinez \r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez</a><br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nBased on my understanding, the problems you are facing could be related to the following causes:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>\nThe error related to <strong>region.Deactivate(view)</strong> is due to the fact that you are probably trying to deactivate a view inside an <strong>ItemsControl</strong> region or one of its derived classes. Instead of trying to deactivate the view, please use <strong>region.Remove(view)</strong>.<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nRelated to the lack of <strong>ViewModel</strong>, I see that you have <strong>((TaxpayerDetailsView) view).DataContext = null</strong> in your code. If this line is executing, and your view is a singleton, when you try to navigate to it again the container will provide you the same instance that you just removed. This instance will not have a view model as you cleared its <strong>DataContext</strong> property (and properties are only populated by the container when a new instance is created). If this is case, you can solve this by exporting the view as a non-singleton type or by removing the aforementioned line.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nHope this helps,\r<br />\n<br />\nFederico Martinez \r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez</a><br />\n",
