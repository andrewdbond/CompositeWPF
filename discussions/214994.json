Using &quot;this&quot; as a variable name doesn't even make sense in that method - there couldn't have been any reason for it other than the dev insisting on straying from common sense identifier naming guidelines.</p>\r\n<p>I normally don't care too much about the naming conventions people use - even when they opt for such an unusual language element. But as r2musings said, Prism is seen as a *reference implementation*. So please keep the cowboy coding out of it.</p>\r\n<p>For those who saw this and wondered what the language construct was doing - it is just a way to escape the identifier name so that you could bypass the language rule that disallows using reserved words as identifiers. A far more commonplace (and acceptable) usage of this construct is for string literals that contain backslashes (such as file paths): &quot;\\\\windows\\\\system32&quot; can be written as &quot;\\windows\\system32&quot;.</p>",
