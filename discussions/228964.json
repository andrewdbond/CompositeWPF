    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>The recommended approach is to add a view with this checkbox in that particular region of your shell window using either View Discovery or View Injection. For more information on these two topic, you could take a look at the following sections on MSDN:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921103(PandP.20).aspx\">How to: Show a View in a Region Using View Discovery UI Composition</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921076(PandP.20).aspx\">How to: Show a View in a Region Using View Injection UI Composition</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I do not know your exact scenario, but if you consider necessary to reference your shell windows from a view, I would suggest you to share more details of your scenario that help to clarify this situation. This way, we could find a possible approach that fits with your scenario.</p>\r\n<p>I hope this help.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
