I installed it.  I'm trying to build/ run the BasicMVVMQuickstart_Desktop.  The build gets the error &quot;The remote server returned an error: (407) Proxy Authentication Required.&quot; \r<br />\n<br />\nThis seems really odd to me.  Why would a build be trying to connect to something?  Anyone have a solution to this problem?<br />\n",
