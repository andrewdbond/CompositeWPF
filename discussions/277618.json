When application modules share some dll... every XAP have its own copy of this dll</p>\r\n<p>Is there any way to reduce this in runtime... If I'm getting this right user is downloading shell with all dll's inside and then with every module loaded to application another copy of dll is downloaded inside xap file of modules. Can I prevent this to load\r\n dll only one time?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
