The example that comes with the Prism samples and documentation uses silverlight, and from what I can see the dll files are slightly different.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I understand how it should work, I just want to see a simple example where I can bind a command to a button in my view and see the flow through the viewmodel where I can see a prompt appear, then do something based on whether the user answers yes or no.&nbsp;\r\n I know it has to be possible, but in the interests of preserving my sanity can anyone help!!!</p>\r\n",
