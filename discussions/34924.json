I didn't find any sample source code\r\nwith a KeyBinding.<br>\r\nI understand that it is impossible to create it in the XAML code\r\nbecause the following code do not work since the KeyBinding.Command\r\nproperty is not a DependencyProperty:<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;KeyBinding Command=&quot;{Binding CreateVoiceInteractionCommand}&quot; Gesture=&quot;CTRL+F2&quot;/&gt;<br>\r\nSo I do the following in the c# code:<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; InputBindings.Add(new KeyBinding(Model.CreateVoiceInteractionCommand, Key.F2, ModifierKeys.Control));<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the best practice about shortcut keys? Moreover, I get some\r\nfocus issue when I add a View in a Region ! So, the shortcut are not\r\nalways working :-)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegis\r\n",

    "Html": "<strong>Can DelegateCommands be replaced with Routed Commands?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</strong>&quot;No, because both are meant for two different purposes. Routed commands, suchas <strong>Cut</strong>, <strong>Copy</strong>, and <strong>Paste</strong>, are meant for controls withcommand binding that live within the logical tree and that will have the focusfor the intent of the command. They can also be used for general purposes if itis acceptable to put centralized command handling at the root window or pageelement and have it as part of the view. However, that approach does not scalefor composite applications, so the <strong>DelegateCommand</strong> approach allows you tohave the flexibility of multiple command handlers that live outside the logicaltree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom CAG Help Files - Technical Concepts -&gt; Commands<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope this helps,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndres Olivares\r\n",
