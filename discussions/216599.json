This works great.</p>\r\n<p>However, now I need more control over the way the views are shown. For example, I have a module CustomerManagement that can be activated more than once; and so its views should be displayed in for example a tab control on demand (and of course each view has its own view model). Or even better, instead of a tab control it would be great if the AvalonDock document pane could be used.</p>\r\n<p>Can anyone explain how this can be done with PRISM?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

However, it is  not possible to unload or reload them.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, as you  mentioned the necessity of controlling &ldquo;views&rdquo;, we thought your  application would require to add, remove, activate, etc views from the  RegionManager, so you can take a look at this <a href=\"View.aspx?ThreadId=217492\">forum  thread</a>, since this requirement was recently treated over there.</p>\r\n<p id=4f08c810-66af-012d-b470-123139097e21>Please let me know if  this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=4f08e530-66af-012d-b471-123139097e21>Fernando  Antivero    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>",
