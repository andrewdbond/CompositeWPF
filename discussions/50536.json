My thought is to attach this to a property on the Application object as a shared instance. I want to keep the download lightweight and thus want to use the bare minimum to achieve this. Is the event aggregator aspect of this easily extractable?\r\n",

As the documentation says, it is <i>“…a lightweight library—you can choose the library capabilities you want to include.”</i>  Therefore you should have no problem creating a project with only the necessary files required to use the EventAggregator<b> for</b> <b>Silverlight</b> and building it, as it does not depend on other features of the CAL.
