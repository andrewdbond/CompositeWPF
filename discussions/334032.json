Currently I am converting a WinForms application to WPF using Prism and have the basic skeleton of the application completed.\r\n My application has four regions, treeViewRegion (for selecting a view), mainRegion (where the view gets injected), a menuBarRegion, and a ToolBarRegion. Each mainView inserts itself into the&nbsp;list in the treeviewRegion and also inserts it&rsquo;s own menuView\r\n and toolBarView into the appropriate regions. I started to learn Blend so I wanted to know if there is a way to see all regions in design mode. I was reading about MEFedMVVM, MVVMLight, ViewModelSupport by Brian Fenisio, and a number of blendability articles\r\n by Tomer Shamam. I want to know what the best path to implement this is and if I will be able to see all regions during design time.</p>\r\n",
