    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nFirst of all, there is a known issue in the <strong>Prism 4.1</strong> registration script where the <strong>Prism</strong> libraries for <strong>Silverlight</strong> are registered for <strong>Silverlight 4</strong> instead of <strong>Silverlight 5</strong>. In order to register the <strong>Prism</strong> library properly please modify the <strong>RegisterPrismLibrary.proj</strong> as described in the following work item:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://compositewpf.codeplex.com/workitem/9225\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bug in RegisterPrismLibrary.proj (Prism v4.1)</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nIf you wish to add the <strong>Prism</strong> libraries manually to your application or to the quick starts, take into account that there are different versions of the library for each supported platform:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>\\Bin\\Desktop\\ - contains the compiled Prism library for .<strong>NET 4.0.</strong></li>\n<li>\\Bin\\Silverlight\\ - contains the compiled Prism library for <strong>Silverlight</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n\\Bin\\Phone\\ - contains the compiled Prism library for <strong>Windows Phone</strong>.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nAlthough most of the quick starts included in <strong>Prism</strong> were implemented in <strong>Silverlight</strong>, most of the concepts and functionalities they portray can also be used in <strong>WPF</strong>. Therefore, I believe you could still find the <strong>Silverlight</strong> quick starts useful in order to learn about the capabilities provided by <strong>Prism</strong> and then apply them in your <strong>WPF</strong> application as you see fit.\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope this helps,\r<br />\n<br />\nDamian Cherubini\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a><br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nBased on my understanding, you seem to be facing a configuration problem. If you want to use the <strong>MVVM Quickstart</strong> from Prism 4.1, you will need to have both <strong>Silverlight 5</strong> and <strong>Silverlight 5 SDK</strong> installed to make it work out of the box. Regarding your missing assemblies you are listing, if your <strong>Quickstart</strong> solution still don't find them you can add them manually from your <strong>LIB</strong> folder inside the folder where you have installed Prism.\r<br />\n<br />\nNote: Prism 4.1 is designed to work with <strong>.NET Framework 4.0</strong>. In order to make it work with <strong>.NET Framework 4.5</strong>,  you can recompile Prism solution targeting that framework or you can download <strong>Prism for NET 4.5</strong>.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\n<br />\nFederico Martinez \r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez</a> <br />\n",
