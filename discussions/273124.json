    "Html": "<p>Hi Louis,</p>\r\n<p>Basically, if the view does not get disposed, it means that something is holding an strong reference to the view. There are several reasons because this could happen.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if you register the view as a <strong>Singleton</strong>, the container will hold an instance (the singleton instance) of the view as long as the container itself is kept alive.</p>\r\n<p>Also, a strong reference to the view could be holded if your are using <strong>Interaction Requests</strong>, as there is <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/workitem/8532\">a known issue</a> where using <strong>Interaction Requests</strong> creates memory leaks, so the view is never destroyed.</p>\r\n<p>If this does not solve your problem, it would be helpful if you could provide us with a repro-sample application portraying this problem, so we could get a better understanding of your scenario and help you find the cause behind this problem.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" target=\"_blank\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",

I come from a C&#43;&#43; background and I am used to when I use the delete operator</p>\r\n<p>on instantiated items, I can see the destructor called as soon as I call delete on the object.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>I kept a watchful eye on the items that I am creating in this Silverlight project.</p>\r\n<p>I then see after I drive the program a bit and go about my tasks in it, I now and then see the line</p>\r\n<p>I have been looking for in the output window of Visual Studio. Just a simple line of text saying item</p>\r\n<p>destructed. When I first saw this I was indeed very happy. But looking into the matter further, I again see that</p>\r\n<p>the amount of items I instantiate are not directly equal to the amount destructed. There is also no way of knowing when an</p>\r\n<p>item is going to be destructed. For example if I quickly open 10 editors and play around a bit and close them all one by one,</p>\r\n<p>I can expect to see two or three being destructed and perhaps over time another one.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>I would like to have it that when I push close on a window, I would like it right then to be destructed.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>I will upload the default prism navigation with unity project to skydrive for those who do not have it.</p>\r\n<p>The only change I have made to the entire application is adding a destructor to the itemviewviewmodel.</p>\r\n<p>In it I simply write a line to the output window.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Hopefully someone can help see how to better this.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Louis</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",
