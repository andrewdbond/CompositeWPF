For example, the user can ask to create a product from the main menu <br>that is in the MainHeader Module or from Quick Access Toolbar that is treated by another <br>module.</p>\r\n<p>The commands must be global and must be treated by one class.

I have a global CommandId table and the <br>modules that execute the commands fire an event that is subscribed by the <br>CommandController class.</p>\r\n<p>But in this case I have, in fact, local commands that notify the global controller using<br>events.</p>\r\n<p>Is it the best practice ???</p>\r\n<p>How could I define the commands globally and drive their execution to the same class<br>no mather&nbsp;which module&nbsp;triggered them.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

You can read about composite commands in the following articles from the Prism documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458928.aspx\">Commands</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458862.aspx\">How to: Create Globally Available Commands</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458878.aspx\">Communication</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p id=d386dde0-d7aa-012c-1efb-12313b030246>The <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458919.aspx\">Prism RI</a> and the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458890.aspx\">Commanding Quickstart</a> solutions that come with Prism use composite commands, so you might find them useful as well.</p>\r\n<p id=d386ffa0-d7aa-012c-1efc-12313b030246>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=d3871ec0-d7aa-012c-1efd-12313b030246>Damian Schenkelman    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>",
