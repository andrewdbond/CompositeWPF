What do you propose to use instead when using Composite WPF and it's regions. A region only supports a name. Would you create specific attached properties? What are your ideas about that issue?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\nTschaena<br>\r\n",

    "Html": "One of the methods I use to solve this issue is to use databinding. For example in a tabcontrol you can modify ItemContainerStyle.This way you can specify a custom control template that for example binds the title property of the view to the header of a tabitem. This trick also works for other controls that are based on the itemscontrol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: I wrote a blogpost on how to exactly do this&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.infosupport.com/blogs/willemm/archive/2008/07/15/Customizing-regions-in-CompositeWPF.aspx\">http://blogs.infosupport.com/blogs/willemm/archive/2008/07/15/Customizing-regions-in-CompositeWPF.aspx</a>&nbsp;it might help get your problem solved.\r\n",
