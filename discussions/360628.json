As <strong>RibbonWindow </strong>inherits from type <strong>Window</strong>, I believe this limitation is present in it too. You can find better support regarding this specific item in the <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en/wpf/threads/\">WPF Forums</a>.<strong></strong></li>\r\n<li>Also,<strong> StackPanel </strong>is a control which inherits from type <strong>Panel</strong>. As <strong>Prism </strong>does not provide region adapters for <strong>Panels </strong>as out of the box, it's not possible to define a <strong>StackPanel </strong>as a region by default.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
