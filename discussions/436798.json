The closest thing I see is one that just targets the .NET 4.5 framework, but really doesn't take advantage of a lot of things it offers. I remember seeing a roadmap that listed the release around Jan/Feb, but it's now halfway through March. Any updates on what issues are planning to be addressed and a timeline estimate? Thanks!<br />\n",
