I had it in both 11609 and 12146, have now switched to the svn source hoping to possibly see any new movements early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan I ask how you're finding Prism? I'm a bit two sided with it, I think I'm struggling with it just a little, I always found CAB a little heavy to swallow and now while it's a smaller pill, still finding prism a little hard to swallow too. I hope as more guidance and samples come out it will make things a little easier for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing is I totally get what WPF is trying to do, but how do you get the flexibility of WPF with compile time safety? I'm finding that most of my problems attribute to errors in my XAML that, due to disconnecting my UI from my model, there's no real XAML test coverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shouldn't have posted this here, but just thought I'd see how someone closer to home is going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Brett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div style=\"border-style:dotted none;border-color:rgb(170, 170, 170) -moz-use-text-color;border-width:0.1em medium;margin:1em 0em 2.5em 3em;padding:0.2em;font-style:italic\"><br>\r\njtango18 wrote:<br>\r\nHey Brett,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour solution is basically what I did to get around this.
