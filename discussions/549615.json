Today in our classic WPF application we are using MVVM Light tool kit and use the Messenger feature to send message to subscribers in order to react to receive messages. That is quite simple to implement\r<br />\n<br />\nBased on that I have different question hoping you could answer on helping me going to correct direction:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>\nDoes MVVM Light toolkit can be use for the MVVM layer instead of the one provided by Prism ?<br />\n</li>\n<li>\nNext based on my scenario I will have 3 different screen accessible like a panorama, then each screen will have his own region. Except the fact of defining the library module that will be used to build my screens and the way to communicate between views, is there any complex thing that I miss and could potentially get my implementation to fail ?<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nIn attached PDF you will see a sample screen layout to illustrate my scenarios.\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://1drv.ms/1wrLfFq\" rel=\"nofollow\">My sample layout</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for advise<br />\n",
