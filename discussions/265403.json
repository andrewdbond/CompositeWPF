    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>Based on my understanding of your scenario, if using events with the Event Aggregator isn't enough to satisfy your communication requirements, you could have a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921122%28PandP.40%29.aspx#sec7\">shared service</a> responsible for saving and retrieving your layout scheme. That service would also coordinate the loading of views (by having a reference to the Region Manager).</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
