This topic was also treated in the following forum thread:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=224259\">ClickOnce for Prism</a> </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In Prism v4 the ClickOnce documentation section has not been updated yet. However, the product team has plans on updating this on the final release of Prism. Additionally, the tool you mentioned could be out of date for .Net 4 and I don&rsquo;t know if there is any official plan to get this updated.</p>\r\n<p>The other forum tread has been copied as a workitem <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/workitem/7140\">here</a>, so you could vote.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p id=e979b660-8ef0-012d-c58c-12313b101d25>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=e979c4b0-8ef0-012d-c58d-12313b101d25>Fernando Antivero <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>",
