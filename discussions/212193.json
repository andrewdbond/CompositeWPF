Take into account that it is not specifically related to Prism&rsquo;s functionality, but to SL4 XAML instead. For that reason you might get a more detailed explanation of the cause of that particular message, and not a more descriptive one, being shown in the <a href=\"http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/\">Silverlight forums</a>.</p>\r\n<p id=95951460-4039-012d-e3ec-123139097e01>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=95952840-4039-012d-e3ed-123139097e01>Damian Schenkelman <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>",
