I'm adding new Tiles to this TileView using RegionManager.AddToRegion() method and it is working fine (I think RequestNavigate would do the trick also).\r<br />\n<br />\nNow I would like to dynamically change the specific view/viewmodel which has been already added to this TileView's region. \r<br />\n<br />\nIs this possible?\r<br />\n<br />\nI would need to somehow get specific view in the region and replace it with new one but what is the correct way to do it? Removing the item and adding a new one does not sound very good because new item is added to the end of item list so position changes...\r<br />\n<br />\nBr,\r<br />\n<br />\nKalle<br />\n",

Therefore, you may find useful the following CodePlex thread which resolves a similar issue from the one you are facing:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/273831\" rel=\"nofollow\">How to sort/rearrange Views in StackPanel</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nNotice that <strong>Regions</strong> have a <strong><em>SortComparison</em></strong> property and you would be able to sort the views each time the <strong>Region.Views</strong> collection changes.\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope this helped you,\r<br />\nRegards.\r<br />\n<br />\nGabriel Ostrowsky\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky</a><br />\n",
