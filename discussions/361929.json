    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for your explanation. As far as I know, <strong>Prism </strong>does not provide any specific guidance or functionality regarding the focus of UI elements as out of the box.</p>\r\n<p>As a possible approach, you could inject the views in your <strong>RadDocking region</strong> by performing <strong>navigation requests</strong> and passing a specific <strong>parameter </strong>as part of the URL (for example, a \"SetFocus\" parameter.) Then you could implement the <strong>INavigationAware </strong>interface in the views and in the <strong>NavigatedTo </strong>method check the aforementioned <strong>parameter </strong>to determine if the view should be \"focused\" or not.</p>\r\n<p>Also, I believe you might find the following thread useful, where different approaches and resources about a similar topic are provided:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/347677\">Setting initial control focus </a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
