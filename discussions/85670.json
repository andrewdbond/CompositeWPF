MyUserControl tests fine, but when I add it to MyModule and run the app, I get this exception:</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Cannot find type 'MyUserControl'. The assembly used when compiling might be different than that used when loading and the type is missing.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>I can fix the error by adding a reference to MyUserControl to&nbsp;my Shell application. But of course, that defeats the whole purpose of Prism, since the Shell does not use MyUserControl--only MyModule uses it.</p>\r\n<p>MyUserControl is based on the WPF Calendar control from the WPF Toolkit, which seems to have a similar problem.</p>\r\n<p>Any suggestions on how to fix this problem without coupling the Shell to MyUserControl? Thanks.</p>",
