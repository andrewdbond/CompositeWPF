They make it possible to compose multiple elements from  independent modules into a single piece of UI, to present a unified view to the  user.</p>\r\n<p>A benefit that leads from using them is that a layout can evolve  independently without affecting the modules that are adding views to it. That  way, you are decoupling layout from functionality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can&nbsp;find a deeper explanation of the aforementioned benefits in these  articles from the Prism documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff650182.aspx\">UI  Composition (design concept)</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648265.aspx\">UI  Composition (technical concept)</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p id=a44c2a60-605c-012d-f7a4-12313b06e8e1>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p id=a44c3ee0-605c-012d-f7a5-12313b06e8e1>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
