I require those tweets to be stored locally and therefore I am using RavenDB in my Client solution. Can you suggest a good architecture/sample which uses PRISM and RavenDB at the client side and fetches data from server using WCF ? <br />\n",

However, I believe there are examples of how to consume a <strong>WCF</strong> service from a <strong>Prism</strong> application. For example, the following blog post by <strong>Guido Maliandi</strong> portrays such scenario:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi/2011/10/using-wcf-services-in-prism-silverlight-applications/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Using WCF services in Prism Silverlight applications</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nAlthough the sample is implemented in <strong>Silverlight</strong> I believe you might find it useful in order to apply the same concepts in a <strong>WPF</strong> application.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nDamian Cherubini\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a><br />\n",
