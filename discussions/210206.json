As the <strong>Bootstrapper</strong> is in charge of creating the Shell in a Prism application, you simply don&rsquo;t have to call the Shell&rsquo;s Show method (assuming it is a window). For example:</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Consolas;font-size:x-small\">\r\n<div style=\"color:black;background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">protected</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">override</span> DependencyObject CreateShell() \r\n       { \r\n           Shell shell = <span style=\"color:blue\">new</span> Shell(); \r\n           <span style=\"color:green\">//shell.Show(); </span>\r\n           <span style=\"color:blue\">return</span> shell; \r\n       }\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p id=253e99a0-3115-012d-7861-1231390c8891>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=253ead30-3115-012d-7862-1231390c8891>Damian Schenkelman <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>",

Since you have not shown the Shell in the <strong>CreateShell</strong> method, you will have to call the its <strong>Show</strong> method to get it displayed.</p>\r\n<p id=66a29be0-4013-012d-e114-12313d013db1>For example,&nbsp;a possible approach to get this done could be subscribing to an event in the Shell presenter/view model, and showing the Shell&nbsp;in the event handler. The event could be published when a particular view is added to a region, and the Shell will be shown once the view has been added.</p>\r\n<p id=66a2af70-4013-012d-e115-12313d013db1>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=66a2c2a0-4013-012d-e116-12313d013db1>Damian Schenkelman <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>",
