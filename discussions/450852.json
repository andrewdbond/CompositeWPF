    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nBased on my understanding, you can only apply style to the content of the <strong>Child Popup Window</strong> that <strong>Silverlight</strong> provides, not the buttons. Nevertheless, you can create your own type of <strong>Child Popup Window</strong> and use the styles you want for the buttons. To do this, you could get the <strong>ChildWindow</strong> code from the <strong>Prism</strong> library, add it to your solution, and modify it accordingly. Then, you just need to call that custom child window from the <strong>PopupChildWindowAction</strong>. \r<br />\n<br />\nHope this helps,\r<br />\n<br />\nFederico Martinez \r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez</a> <br />\n",
