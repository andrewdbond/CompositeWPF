    "Html": "<p>&gt;&gt;1) On button click I want to show the messagebox &amp; I want to assign the owner to that messagebox(that is parent window).</p>\r\n<p>There are two ways for that.</p>\r\n<p>1. You can take a look&nbsp; at this article. <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/KB/architecture/MVVM_Dialogs.aspx?display=Print\">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/architecture/MVVM_Dialogs.aspx?display=Print</a></p>\r\n<p>2. You can have View interface in your ViewModel and use the constructor injection to inject the view.&nbsp; (You shouldn't have strong view reference in VM but you can have an interface of your view if needed.)&nbsp; then, you can set it like view.ShowMessage(yourmessage); Then, you can set the owner in your concrete view.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Example:</p>\r\n<p>interface IView{</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; void ShowMessage(string message);</p>\r\n<p>}</p>\r\n<p>class View : IView {</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void ShowMessage(string message){</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MessageBox.Show(this, message);</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>\r\n<p>}</p>\r\n<p>class ViewModel{</p>\r\n<p>private IView view;</p>\r\n<p>public ViewModel(IVew view){</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; this.view = view;</p>\r\n<p>}</p>\r\n<p>///Call this in On Command.</p>\r\n<p>view.ShowMessage(&quot;This is a msg&quot;);</p>\r\n<p>}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&gt;&gt;2) How can I set the DataContext on UserControl?</p>\r\n<p>Normally, you can set the ViewModel to the DataContext of View at Controller or Module. You can read how to do this in UI Composition Sample.</p>\r\n<p>&gt;&gt;3) Sometime you need to focus on a particular action say when a user clicks on OK, we want to save the data &amp; focus has to go to Contro1 on the form.</p>\r\n<p>You can use the way that I mentioned in my #1 answer.</p>\r\n<p>&gt;&gt;4) There is a datagrid in which 1st column is the drop down, user selects some type of transaction code(functional term), based on that 2nd column is populated with data for that transaction code.</p>\r\n<p>- Bind the selected item of Combobox of 1st column to the Property1 of ViewModel</p>\r\n<p>- Bind the ItemSource of combobox of 2nd column to the Property2 of ViewModel</p>\r\n<p>- In the setter of Property1, you can repopulate the data to Property2.</p>\r\n<p>&gt;&gt;5) How to put DataContext change event in ViewModel, requirement is when the datacontext is changed, I want to refresh particular section of the form.</p>\r\n<p>Why do you want to change the DataContext of ViewModel? I don't understand this question. Could you please tell me more for this one? I may be able to suggest other alternative way to achieve it.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,<br>Michael Sync</p>\r\n<p>Silverlight MVP &amp; Microsoft WPF/Silverlight Insider.</p>\r\n<p>Blog: http://michaelsync.net</p>",

Currently we have a view which has a container,which contains few controls &amp; we have a datacontext change event which refereshed that container. Currently this code is in code behind &amp; we want to move it to ViewModel, can you propose approach for that.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
