I don't know if you have already read it, but you may find helpful the <strong>Prism</strong> documentation with <strong>QuickStarts</strong> applying best practices in the following link:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg406140.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prism 4.1 Guide Documentation</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nRegarding the short sample that you are asking, I think you would find helpful the <strong>HelloWorld QuickStart</strong> solution which shows how <em>Dependency Injection</em> would work with <strong>Module</strong> projects. It has the most simple code by configuring the <strong>Bootstrapper</strong> class and one separate <strong>Module</strong> with a particular <strong>View</strong> page.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou can find the <strong>HelloWorld</strong> sample in the <strong>QuickStarts</strong> folder which you can download on the following source code link:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28950\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prism 4.1 Download site</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nI hope this helped you,\r<br />\nRegards.\r<br />\n<br />\nGabriel Ostrowsky\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky</a><br />\n",
