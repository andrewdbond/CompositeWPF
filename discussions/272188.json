However, have in mind that Prism does not provide support for neither the <strong>Sofa </strong>or <strong>AvalonDock </strong>libraries.</p>\r\n<p>If this does not help you to solve your problem, it could be useful if you could provide us a repro-sample application portraying this problem so that we can check for a possible workaround from Prism's side. If the problem is entirely caused by an AvalonDock issue, and the Sofa library is useful, it's likely that you will find better support regarding your problem in the Avalon forum, as it would be out of the scope of the Prism guidance.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" target=\"_blank\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
