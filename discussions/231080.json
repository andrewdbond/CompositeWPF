In that region i'll load the Modules. For Exemple:</p>\r\n<p>When i click in the Customer button, i ll load the CusomerModule, and show the CustomerView in the MainRegion</p>\r\n<p>When i Click in the Contact button, i ll load the ContactModule, and show the ContactView in the MainRegion.</p>\r\n<p>All modules will be loaded &quot;OnDemand&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>Here my doubts:</p>\r\n<p>1 - I register the CustomerView in the MainRegion, but when i go to the ContactsView, the CostomerView is sitll &quot;Active&quot;?</p>\r\n<p>2 - How can i reload the CustomerView? i dont need only to show that the CustomerView again, because the user can do lots of things in that view, and when he come back to that view, i need to reload that.</p>\r\n<p>3 - In a big app with lots of modules and views, isnt that a problem? lots of views crteated and in memory?</p>\r\n<p>4 - Is there a better solution for that kind of app?</p>\r\n<p>thx.</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>If you active a view in a ContentControl exposed as a region, the current active view will be deactivated. Additionally, Prism has introduced a new <strong>RegionMemberLifetimeBehavior</strong> that removes views from a region when they become deactivated since drop 9.</p>\r\n<p>Either the view or its view  model can opt in to this by using the <strong>RegionMemberLifetimeAttribute</strong> or  the <strong>IRegionMemberLifetime</strong> interface.</p>\r\n<p>For more information, you could take a look at the <strong> RegionMemberLifetimeBehavior </strong>class the following CHM(s):</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> Prism4APIReference-Desktop.chm </li>\r\n<li>Prism4APIReference-Silverlight.chm</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You could see an implementation of this <strong>&nbsp;</strong>in the <strong>Region Navigation Quickstart</strong>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>ComposeEmailViewModel.cs</strong>, see the code comments<strong>.<br></strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There is no problem about the creation of the views when using RequestNavigate, since when a particular view is not located, a new instance of the view will be created. This concept is named <strong>just in time view creation</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>For more information about this you could take a look at the following documentation section in the Prism4.chm:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>View-Switching Navigation Quickstart (new), see the <em>introduction</em> section and the <em>Implementation Details</em> section</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
