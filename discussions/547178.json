However, Prism is highly extensible and it can be extended to add the functionality you are describing. \r<br />\n<br />\nYou might find <a href=\"https://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/280629\" rel=\"nofollow\">this thread</a> useful. It provides a good walk through of the code that should be updated to support something similar to your inquiry.\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope you find this information handy.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nEz.\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.example.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/</a><br />\n",
