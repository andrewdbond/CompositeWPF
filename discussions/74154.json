The equivalent of a static class in VB.NET is a 'Module'. These cannot have Interfaces. I guess I would therefore have to implement the class containing the CompositeCommands as a normal, non-static class and register an instance of it in the container as a Singleton.</p>\r\n<p>Any assistance appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>I am greatly enjoying using the Prism fraework. Thanks guys!</p>",
