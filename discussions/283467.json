When the datacontext of a childviewmodel changes, I would like that the parent viewmodel would be aware of it. For example in the parent viewmodel there should be a property &quot;ChildHasChanged&quot;\r\n that can be accessed from the child viewmodel.</p>\r\n<p>What is the correct way to do this ?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
