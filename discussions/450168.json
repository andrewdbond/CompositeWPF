So I hope this forum can help me.\r<br />\n<br />\nI want to use Pantone Color Manager in Windows. Some days ago I still had Windows XP Home, but the Pantone support gave me the information that this is perhaps tricky. So I bought and installed (only because of Color Manager) Windows 7. And again, the program doesn't work. It hangs some seconds after opening the first splash screen (no exact error message, just Windows standard window). I read the log which I also paste in here. So it seems to be because of prism?\r<br />\n<br />\nDo you know the prerequisites of prism? What in my machine is too old? How can I figure it out?\r<br />\n<br />\nOr is there &quot;another prism&quot; that could work?\r<br />\n<br />\nKind regards!\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>prism.dll:</strong>\r<br />\nPrism Dynamic Link Library\r<br />\nVersion 1.2.0.8217\r<br />\nCopyright X-Rite 2009\r<br />\nSize 42,1 MB\r<br />\nLanguage EN\r<br />\nfilename prism.dll\r<br />\n__\r<br />\nPart of the Log:__\r<br />\n<br />\n2013-07-14 21:32:58,230 [1] INFO  PantoneColorManager.PantoneColorManagerModule - Continuing initializing module: configuring Prism\r<br />\n<strong>2013-07-14 21:32:58,240 [1] ERROR PantoneColorManager.PantoneColorManagerModule - The user's machine is too old to run Prism</strong>\r<br />\n2013-07-14 21:32:58,382 [1] INFO  PantoneDigitalBridge.Core.Utility.UpdateUtility - Update culture is de (ID: 1031)\r<br />\n2013-07-14 21:32:58,729 [1] DEBUG PantoneDigitalBridge.Core.Web.RegistrationWebServiceFactory - Creating registration service SOAP client\r<br />\n2013-07-14 21:32:59,422 [4] DEBUG PantoneDigitalBridge.Core.Models.PaletteSelectionModel - Remembered last selected palette [PANTONE+ Solid Coated].<br />\n",

What you say helps me in a way that it is perhaps really only Pantone that can help me. As I said I hace a CSS ticket open for a month with many questions and no answers. Perhaps I find support directly at X-Rite (Pantone is a part of X-Rite).<br />\n",
