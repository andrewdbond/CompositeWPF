Am I doing the right thing? Or shall I satisfy myself with only learning how to use the library?</p>\r\n<p>I would like to ask about ObservableObject&lt;T&gt;. It wraps an object and derives from FrameworkElement and implements notification. It also contains a Value dependency property. Why do we have such an object? When do we use it? An example?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thank you,<br>Regards</p>",
