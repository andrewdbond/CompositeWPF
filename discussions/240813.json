It appears you have to create the ViewModelBase base class by hand.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Of course this isn't a problem but i was wondering if i am missing something, are there templates available that i am unaware of that automatically create the viewmodelbase classes etc?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Or is it a case of create a viewmodelbase class once by hand and then reusing it in my projects?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\r\n",
