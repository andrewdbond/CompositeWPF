    "Html": "<p>Hi HK.Lee,</p>\r\n<p>I do not know the exact error in your application, but if you are receiving a <strong>ChangedRejectedException</strong>, when using MEF you must mark the <strong>Microsoft.Practices.Prism.MefExtensions.dll</strong> with <strong>Copy Local = False</strong> in your modules. It avoids duplicate imports.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on this topic you could take a look at the following documentation section in the Prism4.chm: <strong>Chapter 4: Modular Application Development</strong>, see the <strong><em>Preparing a Module for remote download using MEF </em></strong>section.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you could check this configuration in the Modularity Quickstart with MEF.</p>\r\n<p>If your problem is not related with this, could you please share a repro sample?</p>\r\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>",
