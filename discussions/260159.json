I&rsquo;m hoping that this application will provide useful tips for people learning or evaluating .NET technologies (e.g., Silverlight, Prism, MEF and\r\n WCF). Since this group has been very supportive when I was learning Prism and MEF, I'd like to ask for a favor. Could you please give me feedback on the application and its associated artifacts? Here&rsquo;s a short list of links related to the project:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://archfirst.org/apps/bfclient-silverlight/bullsfirst.html\">Bullsfirst Silverlight Client</a> (live application)\r\n</li><li><a href=\"http://archfirst.org/demo-apps\">System architecture diagram</a> </li><li><a href=\"http://archfirst.org/books/building-silverlight-client-from-source\">Building from source</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"http://archfirst.org/books/getting-started-prism-and-mef\">Getting started with Prism and MEF</a>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>You can post your comments on the relevant project pages. Any comments you provide can help me improve the application, and also help others see Prism practices and patterns used in a realistic application. Thanks in advance for your time!</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\nNaresh Bhatia</p>\r\n",
