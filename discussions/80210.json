When I close the form, I want to unload the views that are in these regions, but I just can't access them. The RegionManger provided by IoC only find the region of my Shell (which is the region I use for the Popup).</p>\r\n<p>Is there a way to do that?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\r\n<p>Diego.</p>",
