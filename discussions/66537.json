So I created a resource dictionary in the shell project with a style that sets the font size and the font family that is embedded. However when I reference the style from the dynamic module, upon loading the module into the shell page the font doesn't display. The size part of the style renders correctly. However if I add a textblock statically into the shell xaml and that textblock uses the style then all the text renders fine. Its like the font doesn't get loaded unless a non-dynamic object references it first. Whats the deal? Its probably not a bug I'm just curious as to what is happening.<br><br>As a temporary stop gap I have created a textblock in the shell page that uses the style but has no text which forces the font to show up.</p>",
