So, you could take a look at the following documentation section on MSDN:\r\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921081%28PandP.20%29.aspx\">Upgrading from the Composite UI Application Block</a></p>\r\n<p>I hope you can find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero <br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>\r\n",
