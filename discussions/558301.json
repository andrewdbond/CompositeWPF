But when the user clicks the New button in the screen, I want the view to be reinitialized. Or for that matter if the user clicked Cancel in the screen to clear all changes.<br />\n<br />\nHow can I achieve this? I am using Unity as my container.<br />\n<br />\nHere is my quick intro of view and viewmodels that I am using:<br />\n<br />\nTop Region - Menu<br />\nMain Region - Main content<br />\nBottom Region - Status Bar control<br />\n<br />\nThe main content is shown using the following view and viewmodels<br />\n<br />\nHome - HomeViewModel<br />\nNewCustomer - NewCustomerViewModel<br />\nCustomerSearch - CustomerSearchViewModel<br />\n<br />\nI use IRegionMemberLifetime in NewCustomer and set to false upon save. So when the user navigates away and returns, I can reset the viewmodel. I will implement INavigationAware to prompt to save changes if needed.<br />\n<br />\nBut I can't figure out how I can reset the viewmodel when I click the New button in the NewCustomer view itself.<br />\n<br />\nI have my IRegionManager only in the Module initializer class. I use regionmanger.requestnavigate to navigate in the main region between views.<br />\n<br />\nThanks for your help and input. Note: I am using Prism 5.0<br />\n",
