Because updating the registry is a privileged operation, a User Account Control (UAC) prompt will appear if you do not have elevated privileges.</p>\n<p>Also take into account that in some cases it would be necessary to right-click the file and then select \"Run as administrator\".</p>\n<p><em>Take into account that, as far as I know the RegisterPrismBinaries.bat does not put Prism in the GAC.&nbsp; It only adds registry entries so that Visual Studio will list the Prism and Unity assemblies in the Add References dialog.</em></p>\n<p>Please let me know if I have misunderstood your scenario,</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>",
