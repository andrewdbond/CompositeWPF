Regular SL navigation exposes this via NavigationMode property on NavigationCancelEventArgs:\r\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.navigation.navigatingcanceleventargs.navigationmode.aspx\">\r\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.navigation.navigatingcanceleventargs.navigationmode.aspx</a></p>\r\n<p>I think this informaiton should be also exposed on the NavigationContext because it is sometimes important to the logic to determine if we navigate to new page or going back the stack. In my scenario I'm trying to add page transition animation and would\r\n like to run different animaitons for going forward or back.</p>\r\n",
