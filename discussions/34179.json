If you use the StackPanel and attempt to load&nbsp;a view containing any kind of ListView inside that StackPanel's tree, said ListView will never scroll vertically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least I can't figure a way to make it work. I've replaced the ListView's ItemsPanel and tried the equivalent with Styles. No dice. Oh, I can stick a DockPanel in there (and give up virtualizating the ListView) but now it scrolls horizontally and no amount of fiddling with DockPanel.Dock seems to make a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a big problem for us because people use StackPanels all the time, not knowing what havoc they create for nested views.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy reading of Chris Anderson's &quot;Essential WPF&quot; says this problem is intractible (&quot;StackPanel must be used carefully because it measures children using an infinite width or height based on the orientation. This lack of a control on size can break other child layout panels, specifically causing problems for .. ScrollViewer. ... There is no way to avoid this problem with StackPanel.&quot; (p.190)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's the scenario:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;!--&nbsp;Scrolls ok&nbsp;--&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;DockPanel&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&lt;ListBox ItemsSource=&quot;{Binding}&quot;/&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;!-- bind to lots of items --&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;/DockPanel&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;!-- Won't scroll for me --&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;StackPanel&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&lt;ListBox ItemsSource=&quot;{Binding}&quot;/&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;!-- bind to lots of items --&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;/StackPanel&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n",

    "Html": "Let me try to&nbsp;clarify. I am warning against using&nbsp;StackPanel in any situation in which someone might introduce a ListView within that StackPanel. Imagine&nbsp;this structure:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&lt;StackPanel x:Name=&quot;Oops&quot;&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;ContentControl x:Name=&quot;NestedRegion&quot;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Width=&quot;Auto&quot; Height=&quot;Auto&quot;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Stretch&quot;&nbsp; VerticalAlignment=&quot;Stretch&quot;/&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;/StackPanel&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe author of this layout view is inviting clients to add views&nbsp;to &quot;NestedRegion&quot;. Unfortunately, &quot;NestedRegion&quot; is unconstrained and will not scroll any material placed inside of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo illustrate, add a simple view to &quot;NestedRegion&quot; such as:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;ScrollViewer&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;ListBox ItemsSource=&quot;{Binding}&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- bind to lots of items --&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;/ScrollViewer&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ScrollViewer&nbsp;does not help. In fact, you will see a big empty scrollbar on the right .. with no opportunity to scroll. The&nbsp;ListBox actually has its own&nbsp;ScrollViewer in its default ItemsPanelTemplate so all we are doing is doubling up on ScrollViewers .. to no avail. The author of the &quot;Oops&quot; view holding &quot;NestedRegion&quot; has handcuffed all clients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly, if the author of &quot;Oops&quot; tries to compensate by rewriting his view as:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&lt;ScrollViewer x:Name=&quot;OopsAgain&quot;&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;StackPanel &gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;ContentControl x:Name=&quot;NestedRegion&quot;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Width=&quot;Auto&quot; Height=&quot;Auto&quot;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Stretch&quot;&nbsp; VerticalAlignment=&quot;Stretch&quot;/&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/StackPanel&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;/ScrollViewer&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.. a ScrollViewer will appear ... but now it covers the entirety of&nbsp; each view added to NestedRegion. It does not help an embedded ListView scroll properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make this evident, imagine&nbsp;we add a view to NestedRegion consisting of a DockPanel holding:<br>\r\n<br>\r\na) Label &quot;A&quot;<br>\r\nb) A ListView &quot;B&quot;&nbsp;with lots of stuff<br>\r\nc) Label &quot;C&quot;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's a schematic representation of the entire&nbsp;logical tree:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;ScrollViewer x:Name=&quot;OopsAgain&quot;&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp; &lt;StackPanel&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ContentControl x:Name=&quot;NestedRegion&quot;&nbsp;&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!------&nbsp;view added to &quot;NestedRegion -----&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;DockPanel&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Label Content=&quot;A&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DockPanel.Dock=&quot;Top&quot;/&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;ListView&nbsp;x:Name=&quot;B&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;DockPanel.Dock=&quot;Top&quot; ... /&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Label Content=&quot;C&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DockPanel.Dock=&quot;Top&quot;/&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/DockPanel &gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;!-------------------------------------------&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/ContentControl&gt;<br>\r\n&nbsp; &lt;/StackPanel&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;/ScrollViewer&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou&nbsp;would see that, yes, there is scrolling of the added DockPanel .. but of the whole DockPanel. You can see Label&nbsp;&quot;A&quot; but you can't see Label &quot;C&quot; until you have scrolled the entire length of the ListView &quot;B&quot;. That's not what I, the hopeful author of the added view,&nbsp;intend. I want to see Label &quot;A', a scrollable ListView &quot;B&quot;, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">and</span> Label &quot;C&quot; ... all at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<strong>The lesson: When you write a view with a region, do not&nbsp;let a&nbsp;StackPanel appear as an ancestor of that region.</strong><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope I'm wrong.<br>\r\n",
