One of these styles has an embedded font (rockwell). I reference this style as a static resource in other modules.</p>\r\n<p>Problem #1: The style does not appear to be applied to anything in any dynamically loaded module UNLESS there is some control in the Shell.xaml that uses that style. The workaround that I have used is to make a 0x0 textblock in the shell that uses this style.</p>\r\n<p>Problem #2: The style cannot be applied to multiple dynamically loaded modules. If I use the above workaround the first view that I display from the first module actually displays the embedded font. However when I load the second module and add a view to the region I get the following error &quot;Attribute {StaticResource RockwellFontTextBlock} value is out of range.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>",
