You can sign the CAL assemblies with your own key (as you have the source code for the library) and then simply use the signed assemblies in your projects so you can sign them. You will notice that all assemblies that the CAL references are already signed, so there should be no problem there.</p>\r\n<p id=5ba19540-89db-012c-0bba-12313b009c21>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=5ba1a7e0-89db-012c-0bbb-12313b009c21>Damian Schenkelman    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>",
