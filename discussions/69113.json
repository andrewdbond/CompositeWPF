The simple workaround is firing an event with a payload that means  nothing (make it an object an always send null).</p>\r\n<p>If you definitely require that the event is sent without a payload, you could  have a class inherit from EventBase and make a copy most code from  CompositePresentationEvent&lt;T&gt;, but make it non-generic. Take into account  that it is not the only class you will have to modify, as some other classes  depend on the generic payload.</p>\r\n<p>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p>Damian Schenkelman <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
