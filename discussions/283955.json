Based on my understanding <strong>ILmerge </strong>doesn&rsquo;t support WPF applications, because of the way XAML is compiled, so it could be possible that you might find some issues when using it with Prism applications.</p>\n<p>You can find more information in the <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mbarnett/ilmerge.aspx\"> ILMerge website</a>.</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>",
