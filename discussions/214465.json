You  should replace the reference to <strong>Microsoft.Practices.Composite.UnityExtensions</strong> version 1.2 with version 2.0 of the same assembly, which you can find  inside the <a href=\"../releases/view/46046\">Prism 2.2  release</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Please note that, due to the fact that you are  upgrading to Unity 2.0, the generic methods such as <strong>Resolve&lt;T&gt;</strong> are now located in extension methods, so you should change the using  statements in your classes. You can find more information about this in <a href=\"View.aspx?ThreadId=210756\">this  thread</a>.</p>\r\n<p id=a6c64600-5549-012d-08b3-12313d00b9f1>I hope  you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p id=a6c67240-5549-012d-08b4-12313d00b9f1>Guido  Leandro Maliandi    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
