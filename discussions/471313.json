Essentially singletons services available to all modules.\r<br />\n<br />\nIt works if those singletons are used in modules, since the bootstrapper register those services...\r<br />\nBut what about other objects in the infrastructure if they need a singleton's instance? cannot be tested without bootsrapper registration? I could possibly add a typical GetInstance() fct and use it... but am I wrong?\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm now thinking about creating a Common assembly different from the infrastructure.

If this is that case  than i think you can achieve this by \r<br />\nregistering service in unity container and get that service  by using service locator class  in your different modules.\r<br />\n<br />\nHoping this will help you.\r<br />\n<br />\nPankaj Goswami<br />\n",
