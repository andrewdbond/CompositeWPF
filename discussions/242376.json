    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi Indro,</p>\r\n<p>Views can also hold regions, so you could have your View 3 define a region, and add View 1 and View 3 to that region. Then, you could add View 3 to Region A, which will result in the composite view (containing both View 1 and View 2) being added to the aforementioned\r\n region.</p>\r\n<p>In case you want to add more than one instance of View 3, you should use scoped regions, since there can't be more than one region with the same name inside the same region manager. You might find the following\r\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921098%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">chapter</a> from the Prism MSDN documentation useful to this purpose. In the chapter, there are also explanations on the different approaches for UI Composition. If your composition\r\n should be static, you could benefit from the View Discovery approach.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>\r\n",
