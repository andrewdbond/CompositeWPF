I pulled the latest bits drop down and I have a question about the dynamic loading of the modules. As I understand, each module would (or could) be developed and deployed independently. Am I correct in assuming that ClickOnce deployment will be supported, and if so, how does this relate to the modules? Edit*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't go through the Modularity Quickstart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I see the different quickstarts, it looks to me that Prism is a guidance and NOT a framework. Is this correct? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is an issue with modualrity on which I could use some guidance. If teams would be discretely developing modules, what would be the best approach for versioning? e.g. How would the modules be loaded if AD drives the ModuleLoaderService? My initial thought is DB driven module disovery and declarative security, use AD for roles, but as far as deployment, I'm a bit stumped.<br>\r\n",
