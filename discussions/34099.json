If anyone is interested you can get the code <a href=\"http://www.jphamilton.net/post/Building-an-quot3bEnterprisequot3b-Composite-Silverlight-Application.aspx\">here</a>. I would definitely like to get some feedback. The sample itself kind of sucks but I think the code is worth a peek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.P.\r\n",
