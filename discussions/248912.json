I thought it was simply a matter of registering my new module in the StockTraderRIBootStrapper as follows:</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: white; color: black;\">\n<pre><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.AggregateCatalog.Catalogs.Add(<span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> AssemblyCatalog(<span style=\"color: blue;\">typeof</span>(NewModule).Assembly));\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>And use declarative attributes on the module's View class to register/associate&nbsp;the view with MainRegion so it can be discovered at runtime</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: white; color: black;\">\n<pre>[ViewExport(RegionName = RegionNames.MainRegion)]\r\n[PartCreationPolicy(CreationPolicy.NonShared)]\r\n<span style=\"color: blue;\">public</span> <span style=\"color: blue;\">partial</span> <span style=\"color: blue;\">class</span> NewModuleView : UserControl\r\n{\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>But while the module does initialise, the view is not being discovered by the ImportMany in&nbsp;AutoPopulateExportedViewsBehavior in the StockTraderRI InfraStructure library. Debugging tells me that RegisteredViews filled by the following ImportMany is not populating with my new view.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: white; color: black;\">\n<pre>[ImportMany(AllowRecomposition = <span style=\"color: blue;\">true</span>)]\r\n<span style=\"color: blue;\">public</span> Lazy&lt;<span style=\"color: blue;\">object</span>, IViewRegionRegistration&gt;[] RegisteredViews { <span style=\"color: blue;\">get</span>; <span style=\"color: blue;\">set</span>; }\r\n</pre>\n</div>\n<p>What am I missing? Or how can I debug further? I don't know how to get inside RegisteredViews to debug how its being populated</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi Guido,</p>\r\n<p>Yes, I have the HeaderInfo property defined as you describe already. It would probably throw an error if I didn't have it defined?</p>\r\n<p>At the moment this is looking like an MEF composition discovery problem as the [ImportMany] is not discovering the View that I marked with the [ViewExport] attribute. This kind of thing seems to be not uncommon with MEF according to this guide: <a href=\"http://mef.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Debugging%20and%20Diagnostics&amp;referringTitle=Guide\">http://mef.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Debugging%20and%20Diagnostics&amp;referringTitle=Guide</a></p>\r\n<p>Any other ideas?

    "Html": "<p>Gary,</p>\r\n<p>In that case, you should confirm whether your module is being correctly loaded. I was able to add a custom view to the <strong>MainRegion</strong> in the <strong>StockTraderRI</strong> (which is an <strong>AnimatedTabControl</strong>) by using the <strong>ViewExport </strong>attribute, but I have defined the <strong>HeaderInfo</strong> property in the <strong>ViewModel</strong>. If the property is defined in the view, then I had to add the following line in the view's constructor in order for it to work:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.DataContext = <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>;\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\nOn the other hand, if I omitted that property, no error was thrown; the view was added but the header for the tab was empty, so there was a \"blank space\" in the tab control's header, which sent me to that view if I clicked it.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
