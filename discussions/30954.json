Instead you&nbsp;just support ItemsControl region adapter.<br>\r\nI know why you did this, because you want us to provide data types as views. And data can be applied to ItemsControl but panels accept only UIElements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to MVP&nbsp;views should only be visual elements and not data. And data should be the model and not view AND model!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenjamin\r\n",
