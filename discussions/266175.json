I intend to use PRISM in both SL and WPF, but should I&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;Unity or MEF? Both seem to have capabilities beyond anything I will need,\r\n but do they both have a future or is Unity being faced out for MEF, or vice versa? I noticed that MEF is included in .NET 4, does that mean it's considered the way forward?</p>\r\n<p>TIA</p>\r\n<p>Dennis</p>\r\n",
