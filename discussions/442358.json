    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nIt could be useful to know what exception you are receiving in order to have a better understanding of the error you are experiencing.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso, if I have understood correctly, you want to initialize the module again? If so, in Prism it's not possible (or recommended) to load and initialize a module more than once. Is there any logic in the initialization of the module that you need to execute several times?\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\n<br />\nDamian Cherubini\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a><br />\n",
