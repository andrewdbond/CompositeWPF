I’ve written a fairly large duplex client/server application using SL2 without using Prism. The server side is pretty well along. Where I am stuck is on the client. I am trying to implement an MVVM client architecture that gets its data from a duplex push instead of from a web service.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">All examples that I can find show an MVVM model that has direct access to a web service or a database and can simply use linq to fulfill requests from the UI as the user clicks on various widgets. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">In my case, the client is going to be constantly receiving updates. These updates need to make their way to the model and then have the UI update accordingly.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">Does Prism support this model? Are there any examples?</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">Thanks,</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">Rick</span></p>\r\n",

Although the CAL (Prism library) does not provide any special feature to facilitate your scenario, it will support it.

    "Html": "Thank you for your answer. The question is not so much how Prism works with MVVM as it is how does Prism work with a model underneath MVVM that is receiving data from a duplex channel as opposed to fetching it from a webservice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one case, the user clicks on a widget which causes some data to be fetched from a server. In the other case, the model is being fed data on a background thread from which it must force a UI update.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick\r\n",
