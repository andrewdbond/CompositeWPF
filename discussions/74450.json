Consider each widget as a View which is implemented into a different Module. The Shell has 2 regions. The first one displays just a list with the widget names from all available widgets in the modules. The second one is just an empty region where a user can drop a view into it. Dragging an item from the list (1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; region) into the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; region should display the appropriate view.</p>\r\n<p>Is there a way to do that?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance,<br>Greg</p>",

If this is the case, some time ago I blogged about dragging views from one region to another, so you might find <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/2009/06/27/how-to-drag-and-drop-silverlight-views-between-regions-in-prism-v2/\">this post</a> useful.</p>\r\n<p id=08f9af30-af7f-012c-fc6a-12313b018621>Take into account that the post does not account for your full scenario, as it simply drags the view between different regions but does not show a new view when dropping. However, with some minor changes you should be able to get it working.</p>\r\n<p id=08f9cba0-af7f-012c-fc6b-12313b018621>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=08f9e290-af7f-012c-fc6c-12313b018621>Damian Schenkelman    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>",
