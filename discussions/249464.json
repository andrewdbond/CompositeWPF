For example when you start the app and click the button for a new mail and then close the window, the NewEMailViewModel and the NewEMailUseCase still exists in the memory. I am searching for the reason  for several hours, but don't find it. Now I hope someone there can help me.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n<p>You can download my OutlookStyleApp ported to Prism V4 from <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4701983/OutlookStyleApp.rar\"> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4701983/OutlookStyleApp.rar</a><br />Here can you find a Printscreen of the Graph of NewEmailUseCase, after the NewEmail-Window is closed (and the UseCase should also be close/ended):<br /><a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4701983/path1.png\">NewEmailUseCase</a><br />And here a picture of the graph in the same sitution of NewEmailViewModel:<br /><a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4701983/path2.png\">NewEmailViewModel</a></p>\n<p>Best Regards, Thomas</p>",
