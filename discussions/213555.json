Sounds great but for the last month I've not seen any posts about the new version. I realize that it might be 3rd qtr before its release but it would be great to get some feedback on progress. At the very least maybe someone could update the page so it allows us to  specify a Prism v4 tag so that we can start some discussions. Please don't leave us in the dark in the same way that the people who have been waiting years for the Microsoft Ribbon.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in anticipation,</p>\r\n<p>Richard</p>",

Nevertheless, as you can read in <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dphill/archive/2010/04/28/prism-4-0-have-your-say.aspx\">David Hill&rsquo;s post</a> the team has kicked off the project. Hopefully, we can expect a drop soon, although there is not official information about it.<br>Regarding the Prism v4 tag, this is something that we plan to create when the first drop is officially published.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>",

As for Prism roadmap I think that you&rsquo;d want to know that its first stable version has been released 2 years ago and nowadays<span style=\"color:#1f497d\"> </span>p&amp;p is already working on&nbsp;Prism v4 (for more information you could take a look<span style=\"color:#1f497d\"> </span><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/blaine/archive/2010/06/16/prism-4-0-plan-amp-drop-available-on-codeplex.aspx\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/blaine/archive/2010/08/03/prism-4-0-ctp-available-on-codeplex.aspx\">here</a>).</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\">Additionally, it is important to know that Prism is licensed &quot;as-is&quot;<span style=\"color:#1f497d\">, </span>meaning that you bear the risk of using it, as explained <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/license\">here</a>.&nbsp;For example, this means that nobody could guarantee you backwards compatibility.&nbsp;Though in general the p&amp;p deliverables of Prism provides documentation about how to migrate existent applications from older versions, etc<span style=\"color:#1f497d\">.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt\">On the other hand, take for granted that any time you have a doubt/question, issue, etc. you could make use of this forum, since here you will find a vast community of users and developers willing to help you.</span></p>\r\n<p id=3981e420-7e36-012d-2cf1-123139180535>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=39820db0-7e36-012d-2cf2-123139180535>Fernando Antivero <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>",
