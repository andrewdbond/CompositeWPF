I have been looking for a example for creating regions dynamically and injecting views into it but could not able to find a good example for it So starting this thread.<br />\n<br />\nMy Scenario: We are using Telerik Rad Controls for this.<br />\n<br />\nI have a MEMBER who has multiple ORDERS associated to him.So When the user selects the member, All the orders that are associated to him should be displayed in each RadPane.<br />\nSo I have to generate Radpanes dynamically depending upon the number of orders that the Member had. Generating these RadPanes is working but after these Radpanes are generated I have to Inject a View into it.Here comes the haredest part which I felt to achieve.I will  Explain clearly.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLets say MainView is the view that has to be injected into the RadPane every time when the RadPane created dynamically. <br />\n<br />\nIn MainView we have two ContentControls with names : dynamicDataRegion, dynamicNavigatorRegion as below<br />\n<br />\n&lt;ContentControl x:Name=&quot;dynamicNavigatorContent &quot; Grid.Column=&quot;0&quot; Grid.Row=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;<br />\n&lt;ContentControl x:Name=&quot;dynamicDataContent&quot; Grid.Column=&quot;1&quot; Grid.Row=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;<br />\n<br />\nSo for every RadPane these two regions has to be created dynamically and Inject the view accordingly.<br />\n<br />\nFor this I have used the below code <br />\n foreach (var order in OrderListDetails)<br />\n{<br />\n   //Naming the dynamicRegions<br />\n  string dynamicDataRegion = review.OrderId.ToString();<br />\n  string dynamicNavigatorRegion  = (review.OrderId+&quot;A&quot;).ToString();<br />\n  //Instance of RadPane<br />\n  RadPane radPaneItem = new RadPane();<br />\n //Getting the OrderData<br />\n //This will have all the deatils<br />\n //get the Details related for the OrderId<br />\n<pre><code>     CurrentOrder.GetOrder(order.OrderId);</code></pre>\n\n//Creating an Instance of MainView<br />\n<pre><code>     var coreView = ContextManager.Current.MEFContainer.GetExportedValue&lt;MainView&gt;();\n            ((MainViewModel)coreView.DataContext).GetMember();\n            //Creating and Adding and Navigating</code></pre>\n\nMicrosoft.Practices.Prism.Regions.RegionManager.SetRegionName(coreView.dynamicDataContent, dynamicDataRegion);<br />\nMicrosoft.Practices.Prism.Regions.RegionManager.SetRegionManager(coreView.dynamicDataContent,ContextManager.Current.RegionManager);<br />\nDataCollectionDesktopContextManager.Current.RegionManager.RequestNavigate(dynamicDataRegion, ViewNames.DataView);<br />\n<br />\nUpto here It is working fine.This DataView is getting injected dyanamically I am happy for that but when I am trying to do the same for that second view too whic is not working for me.Can anyone help me please on this.Below is the code I have used to inject the Secondview which is NavigationView(which is a TreeView)<br />\n<pre><code>            //Creating and Adding and Navigating</code></pre>\n\nMicrosoft.Practices.Prism.Regions.RegionManager.SetRegionName(coreView.dynamicNavigatorContent , dynamicNavigatorRegion);<br />\nMicrosoft.Practices.Prism.Regions.RegionManager.SetRegionManager(coreView.dynamicNavigatorContent , ContextManager.Current.RegionManager);<br />\n<pre><code>            ContextManager.Current.RegionManager.RequestNavigate(dynamicNavigatorRegion, ViewNames.AbstractionNavigatorView);\n            //assing Mainview to RadPane's Content\n            radPaneItem.Content = coreView;\n            //Panes is a ObeservableCOllection &lt;RadPane&gt;\n            Panes.Add(radPaneItem);\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\nWhen I do this, I am not able to see the Scond view.Only the First view whic i DataView I seeing.Can any one help me on this please.I have been working on this for a long time.<br />\n<br />\nThanks!!<br />\n",
