If for any reason, events need to be &ldquo;filtered&rdquo; based on some criteria, the payload can provide any necessary information.</p>\r\n<p id=3cfc0000-aae3-012c-d41c-12313d006601>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=3cfc1530-aae3-012c-d41d-12313d006601>Damian Schenkelman    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>",
