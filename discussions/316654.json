    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>If I understood correctly, you want to raise an interaction request from the <strong>BVM </strong>view model when the <strong>ModuleB </strong>is initialized and the <strong>BPage </strong>view is added to the region. I have checked your repro-sample application and I believe a possible approach to achieve the aforementioned functionality could be to subscribe to the <strong>Loaded </strong>event of the <strong>BPage </strong>view and raise the interaction request after that event is raised. This can be done, for example, doing something like this:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Add the following method in the <strong>BVM </strong>view model:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\r\n<pre>        <span style=\"color: blue;\">public</span> <span style=\"color: blue;\">void</span> OnViewReady(<span style=\"color: blue;\">object</span> sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n            <span style=\"color: blue;\">if</span> (<span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.executeOnViewReady == <span style=\"color: blue;\">true</span>)\r\n            {\r\n                OKCommand.Execute(<span style=\"color: blue;\">null</span>);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Add the following member in the <strong>BVM </strong>view model:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\r\n<pre>        <span style=\"color: blue;\">private</span> <span style=\"color: blue;\">bool</span> executeOnViewReady = <span style=\"color: blue;\">false</span>;\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Replace the <em><strong>OKCommand.Execute(null);</strong></em> sentence in the <strong>OnNavigatedTo</strong> method of the <strong>BVM </strong>view model with <strong><em>this.executeOnViewReady = true;</em></strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Modify the <strong>vm </strong>property in the <strong>BPage </strong>view to include the following line in its setter:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\r\n<pre>        <span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.Loaded += value.OnViewReady;\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Like this, in the <strong>OnNavigatedTo </strong>method, we set a flag to inform that an interaction request should be raised when the view is ready. When the <strong>Loaded </strong>event of the view is raised, if the aforementioned flag is set, the interaction request will be raised correctly.</p>\r\n<p>However, take into account that the implementation details for the aforementioned functionality will mainly depend of your personal preferences and the requirements of your scenario.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
