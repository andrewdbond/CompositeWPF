However, after  you have loaded a module, the view and all the components that you require to  fulfill your use case (e.g. a viewmodel) can be instantiated more than once, so  you should first load your module, and then make your button call another  component that will be responsible for adding the views to regions.</p>\r\n<p>You might find the following links handy:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405479(v=PandP.40).aspx\">Chapter 4:  Modular Application Development</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921163%28v=PandP.40%29.aspx\">Modularity QuickStarts for Silverlight</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><br />I  hope you find this useful</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>",
