These behaviors will allow you to define a region that, when a view is added to it, will be shown in a new window/popup.</p>\r\n<p>Also, you might find the following threads useful where similar concerns are discussed:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"265715\">Modal Dialog</a> </li>\r\n<li><a href=\"268575\">Popup region implementation for WPF class library</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a>ï»¿</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>",
