In the reference implementation you are using layered user controls. I find that this is very often insufficient. Often there is a requirement to load different windows (dynamically) that needs to be positioned and that have to communicate. So my question is: Will you add more windows (WPF) to the RI? When you got more windows the command and event routing starts to be a pain.<br />So any solutions about how to add more windows to the shell etc would be very much appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks<br />",

    "Html": "\r\nIn the newest drop of Prism we have added an extensible region mechanism, and we have a notion of local regions. <br /><br />Region extensibility makes it very easy for you to create your own regions. You simply create a customer region class that implements IRegion&lt;T&gt; where T is the type of UIElement that should use that region.<br /><br />Local regions allow you to have region managers that are scoped to a specifc view. This allows you to have say an OrderView that contains an OrderHeaderRegion. Each instance of OrderView will have it's own local instance of OrderHeaderRegion it can inject into.<br /><br />As to the commanding, we've done a ton of work in the last two drops related to using commands to fire actions on a specific instance of a view. You can see this in the RI with our new Buy/Sell screen. We're using a new CompositeCommand and ActiveAwareCompositeCommand. Both commands take a collection of child commands that are invoked whenever the composite command's Execute is called. In the same way, calling CanExecute on the composite, will call CanExecute on the children. The difference between the ActiveAware command, is that in this case we have multiple views each contributing a child command, but only one is active at a time. In the case of the Buy/Sell this is what is used when you press the submit button in the toolbar and only the current order gets submitted.<br /><br />You can see more about this in our <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/prism/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Releases&amp;referringTitle=Home\" class=\"externalLink\">release notes<span class=\"externalLinkIcon\" style=\"font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace;\"></span></a><br /> section, by looking at the past iterations notes.<br /><br />",
