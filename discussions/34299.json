All sample seems to use a single window only. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI figured out that by manipulting the UnityBootstrapper&nbsp;I can register more shell windows in the RegionManager, but&nbsp;I guess I also need to make more adjustments when it comes to activating, showing and hiding. <br>\r\nWill there be more problems with this approach down the road? Anyone who has tried this out already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
