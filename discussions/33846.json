When i try to load the second instance the following error occurs &quot;View already exists in region.&quot; This is because the region names of the module that I am trying to load already exists, since the first module have already created them. So I will like to know if there is a way in which I could load this same module but with a different&nbsp; name of regions, in order to avoid this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks.<br>\r\n",
