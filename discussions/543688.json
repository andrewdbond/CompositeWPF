I've tried searching but mostly find people asking the same question from months / years ago. I've read most of the Developers Guide to Microsoft Prism but it doesn't have many examples and is more of an overview of how Prism works, and the examples it does have for MVVM are Silverlight based.\r<br />\n<br />\nAre there books you'd recommend? I've looked at Building Enterprise Applications with WPF and MVVM but it doesn't have the best reviews and most people say its also pretty short when it comes to the code / details.<br />\n",
