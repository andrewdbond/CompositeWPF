    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>Silverlight modules in Prism can be either <strong>Silverlight Class Libraries</strong> or <strong>Silverlight Applications</strong>. The main reason for using applications over class libraries is that the <strong>Silverlight Application</strong> template outputs a xap file by default. You can read more about this in the following thread:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/240958\"><span>How to have XAP against every module</span></a></p>\n<p>However, regardless of whether it is a class library or a Silverlight Application, a module isn't intendede to be run in a stand alone fashion. You might find the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405479%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">modularity chapter</a> from the Prism MSDN documentation useful to further clarify on this.</p>\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
