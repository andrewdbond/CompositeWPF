From the\r\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921153%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">introductory chapter</a> of the Prism MSDN documentation,</p>\r\n<p><em>&quot;Prism provides guidance designed to help you more easily design and build rich, flexible, and easy-to-maintain Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) desktop applications, Silverlight Rich Internet Applications (RIAs), and Windows Phone 7 applications.\r\n Using design patterns that embody important architectural design principles, such as separation of concerns and loose coupling, Prism helps you to design and build applications using loosely coupled components that can evolve independently but that can be\r\n easily and seamlessly integrated into the overall application. These types of applications are known as composite applications.&quot;</em></p>\r\n<p>Prism can be helpful to develop the client that interoperates several services, but not to develop the services themselves. For guidance on Service Oriented Architecture and Web Services, you could check the assets in the\r\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921346.aspx\">Services Development</a> section of the\r\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921345.aspx\">Patterns and Practices MSDN site</a><em>,\r\n</em>for example the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff699491.aspx\">\r\nWeb Service Software Factory</a>.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>\r\n",
