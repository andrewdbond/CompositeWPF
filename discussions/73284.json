CommandParameter does come up in Intellisense but Command does not.</p>\r\n<p>im using visual studio tf 2008, created a silverlight business application with silverlight 3. then created the class from dschenkelman's blog, and this is the result.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>so in short, the commanding works. everything works with 0 errors.. except that Intellisense cannot find &quot;command&quot; which then inturn gives me an error on the error list and it breaks blend from working without commenting out code on the dataform.</p>\r\n<p>all help is appreciated. thanks!</p>",
