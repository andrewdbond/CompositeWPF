But we didn’t upgrade, so I can only say I know relatively well the version from 2 years ago.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>I did have problem writing a container adapter for a 3rd party control I was using! So much so that we didn’t use the region manager in the end and I might have missed out on some of its functionality. For example I am not sure what is this view composition\r\n you are referring about!</div>\r\n<div>If it is “subrebgion” while I do not provide guidance my ideas is hat each “subshell” area expose an interface or (more likely) and the datamodel for it is shared among people accessing it.</div>\r\n<div>Anyway I’ll have a look at the particular area you mentioned!</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>I was not really thinking of putting it on CodePlex as I wanted to keep the functionality small and it is working as it is.
