    "Html": "<p>Hi Experts,</p>\n<p>Is there any way to use RegionManager's RegisterViewWithRegion and RequestNavigate together? I make use of RegisterViewWithRegion at initialization because the region is not yet registered moment. Then, to change the view in the region at a later moment I make use of RequestNavigate. The problem with this setup is that for RequestNavigate to work, the view should be exported explicitly using</p>\n<p>[Export(\"ExplicitViewNameHere\")]</p>\n<p>as described here: <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430861(v=pandp.40).aspx\">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430861(v=pandp.40).aspx</a></p>\n<pre>Important: When the region navigation service creates a view, it requests a type of Object\r\nfrom the container with a name that matches the one supplied in the navigation URI. Various\r\ncontainers provide different registration mechanisms to support this.\r\nFor instance, in Unity you will need to register your views against the Object type, map it to\r\nyour view type, and provide a name that matches the one used in the navigation URI. In MEF, it\r\nis implemented differently and only the contract name is used.\r\nTherefore, as long as the view is exported with a contract name that matches the name in the URI\r\nrequest, the view can be successfully constructed. </pre>\n<p>The problem now is that RegisterViewWithRegion now cannot find the export anymore when using</p>\n<p>regionManager.RegisterViewWithRegion(RegionNames.MyRegion, typeof(MyView))</p>\n<p>Is there any way to solve this or is using both methods together not recommended anyway?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\n<p>Laurens</p>",
