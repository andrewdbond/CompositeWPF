I <br />\nhave the following statements in my code:<br />\n<pre><code>    IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();  \n    container.LoadConfiguration();</code></pre>\n\nThe    IUnityContainer could not be resolved. After a long search I found out, that I have to reference the dll    ...Unity.Configuration  then it worked.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBUT:<br />\nIn the folder Prism\\Bin\\Desktop  the dll Unity.Configuration is not available. <br />\nInstead I found this dll in the folder Prism\\Lib\\Desktop\\Unity.<br />\nI am confused. What is in the Bin-Folder and what is in the Lib-Folder?<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hello Somigur,\r<br />\n<br />\nBased on my understanding, the <strong><em>/Bin</em></strong> folder contains Strong-named and authenticated signed <strong>Prism</strong> binaries while the <strong><em>/Lib</em></strong> foder located on the <strong>Prism</strong> directory stores  pre-built <strong>Prism</strong> binaries so they work out of the box for convenience which actually they are used by <strong>QuickStarts</strong> solutions. However, you should try and use the <strong>Prism</strong> binaries on your system whenever you would be able to.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou can find more related information on the following sites:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430871(v=pandp.40).aspx#sec9\" rel=\"nofollow\">What's New in Prism 4.0: Miscellaneous Changes</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dphill/archive/2009/06/15/prism-quick-start-kit-update.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prism Quick Start Kit Update</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nAs a side note, It may be possible to have <strong>NuGet</strong> packages for future version releases of <strong>Prism</strong>, so this would not be an issue.\r<br />\n<br />\nI hope this helped you, regards.\r<br />\n<br />\nGabriel Ostrowsky\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky</a><br />\n",
