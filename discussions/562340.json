I want to ask for best approach to start doing this.\r<br />\n<br />\nOld application has a starter window (let's call it launcher ) Which that launcher you can start other new windows (diferent projects for each department with diferent functionalities), each separate project that start from launcher can run simultaneously. And in that projects we have other programs on a ribbon tabs (in prism we could name that tabs as modules).\r<br />\n<br />\nWhat would be best approach to start PRISM application? I am thinking of this option:\r<br />\n<br />\nOne separate shells for launcher that start new shells (windows) for each program and in that programs we load modules.\r<br />\n<br />\nI am not sure if that approach is a correct way.\r<br />\nAlso since I am new to PRISM, I am not sure if you can comunicate between shells, i might need to comunicate bettwen shells. \r<br />\nAlso I cant find way to start new shell window with new regionManager from delegate command.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf anyone can help me pick right decision. I would be grateful.\r<br />\nSorry for my poor english.\r<br />\nHal.<br />\n",
