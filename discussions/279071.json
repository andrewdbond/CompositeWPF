    "Html": "<p><span class=\"codeplexpageheader\">Hi,</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"codeplexpageheader\">You could try using command bindings in those buttons, and define your command to implement <strong>View-Switching</strong> navigation in your desired region. To do this you might follow the same approach you used in the <strong>ModuleBTaskButton</strong> button, inside the sample you provided, which is bound to the <strong>ShowModuleBView</strong> command, and ends calling a <strong>regionManager.RequestNavigate</strong> method in its execute method to switch the view in the region.</span></p>\r\n<p><span class=\"codeplexpageheader\">Also we found in the sample that you are using a regular implementation of the <strong>ICommand</strong> interface.This has the disadvantage of having to define one class per command. You could benefit from using the <strong>DelegateCommand</strong> class provided by Prism, which implements <strong>ICommand </strong>and encapsulates two delegates, that each reference a method that can be implemented within your view model class. You will find more information about <strong>DelegateCommands</strong> in the Prism documentation at MSDN:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span class=\"codeplexpageheader\">&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405484%28v=PandP.40%29.aspx#sec11\">Chapter 5: Implementing the MVVM Pattern, Implementing Command Objects </a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span class=\"codeplexpageheader\">I hope you find this helpful.</span></p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a>ï»¿</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"codeplexpageheader\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\" lang=\"EN-US\"></span></span></p>",
