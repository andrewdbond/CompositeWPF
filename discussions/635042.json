With the combination of an implicit DataTemplate containing the View and the View using ViewModelLocator, you can already get dependency injection into the ViewModel easily. And with Regions you can inject views into containers. So I'm curious what scenarios this approach solves that cannot already be easily accomplished with existing Prism functionality.\r<br />\nThanks\r<br />\nBrian<br />\n",
