    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>That decision could be based on your personal preference. A module is generally a set of components grouped by functionality, that together represent a set of related concerns (more information in <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405479%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">this chapter</a> of the Prism MSDN documentation).</p>\n<p>If you consider that it could be helpful to isolate the Newsticker functionality in a separate functional unit of your application, then it might be suitable for you to place it in a separate module. On the other hand, if you consider that the Newsticker  could be coupled with other components without causing problems to your architecture, then it might not be worth the overhead.</p>\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
