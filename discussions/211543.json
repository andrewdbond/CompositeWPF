It is a very simple scenario, and I omitted the controller, but I hope you can get the basic ideas. Take into account that to keep the sample simple, I did not create any interfaces (for the views, presenter, etc). However, that is a recommended approach in your application, as not being tied to a particular implementation increases the testability.</p>\r\n<p id=2e3affc0-3b47-012d-bd7b-1231390f0801>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=2e3b0e40-3b47-012d-bd7c-1231390f0801>Damian Schenkelman <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>",
