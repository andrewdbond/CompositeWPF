With a breakpoint in the constructor I can see that a new view &amp; view model get instantiated each time I navigate to the view, but how can I be certain that they are getting freed up once I've navigated away?\r<br />\n<br />\nI tried implementing IDisposable on the VM to see what happens, but <code>Dispose()</code> never gets called.<br />\n",
