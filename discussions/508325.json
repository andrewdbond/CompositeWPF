    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nThe <strong>Prism.Core</strong> project is a <strong>Portable Class Library</strong> which means that it can be used on several platforms without recompiling the assembly. As far as I know, this type of projects are not supported in <strong>Visual Studio 2013 Express</strong> editions which is why you are getting errors when trying to open the solution.\r<br />\n<br />\nTake into account that the new version of <strong>Prism</strong> is still under development so this project might be changed or removed in the future. Also, once the final drop for this version is released, I believe you might be able to obtain this assembly compiled from a <strong>NuGet</strong> package, which as far as I know should allow you to use it in express editions without problems.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nDamian Cherubini\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a><br />\n",
