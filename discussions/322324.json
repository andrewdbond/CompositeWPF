In my opinion, a view / view model that implements the <strong>IRegionMemberLifetime </strong>interface should usually be removed as a result of being \"replaced\" by another view through a navigation request, as it might be possible that explicitly removing the view (through the <strong>Remove </strong>method of the region) might interfere with the \"<strong><em>navigation</em></strong>\" functionality provided by Prism (for example, if a view / view model have logic implemented in the <strong>OnNavigatedFrom </strong>method, that logic will not be executed if the view is directly removed from the region).</p>\r\n<p>There is an existing work item in the issue tracking portraying this problem, which includes a possible modification to the <strong>ShouldKeepAlive </strong>method of the <strong>RegionMemberLifetimeBehavior </strong>class to avoid this problem:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/workitem/8224\">Work Item 8224: Silverlight - Add/Remove view - ArgumentException</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
