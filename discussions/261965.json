    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>If you application is under an MVVM architecture, one possible reason for this behavior could be that your view model doesn&rsquo;t implement the<strong> INotifyPropertyChanged </strong>interface. Also, if your view models implements <strong>INotifyPropertyChanged</strong>, you need to call the RaisePropertyChange event in order to update the values of your bind controls.</p>\r\n<p>In case you continue experiencing this behavior, it could be helpful if you could provide us with your repro sample (for example, uploading to <a href=\"http://skydrive.live.com/\">SkyDrive</a>) of your solution, so that we can help you find out the cause.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this information useful.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Miguel Bronzovic<br /><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic\">http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
