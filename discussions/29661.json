Then I was thinking I should make it the modules own responsibility to perform long running initialization on a seperate thread. I could possibly control this through a new interface that contains an event for ModuleReady, this way my application could wait for modules to be ready during initialization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are other peoples thoughts? Has anyone acheived background loading of modules?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Brett<br>\r\n",
