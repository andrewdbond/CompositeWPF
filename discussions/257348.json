I could find the solution in plain WPF application but I am not able to figure out the way to do it in WPF application which is built on Prism 4.</p>\r\n<p>If I have a Prism 4 application and want to initate a pop up window into a seperate thread to avoid the UI thread burden , is there any way to do this?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

You might find handy the <strong>DialogActivationBehavior</strong> provided with the <strong>Stock Trader Reference Implementation</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Take into account that this behavior will not guaranteed the same features you have when starting a Prism application. You will have to find a way to access the region manager, make use of the Event aggregator, among others.</p>\r\n<p>Another possibility would be to have two bootstrappers, one for each &ldquo;UI Thread&rdquo;, so that you have all the resources you need available in that thread, as a separate extension of your application.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Miguel Bronzovic<br /><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic\">http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
