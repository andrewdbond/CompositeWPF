This is why, you couldn&rsquo;t find any particular Quickstart that provide this kind of information.</p>\r\n<p>However, if you open some of the Quickstart solutions in <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/releases/view/49963\">Prism v4 CTP</a> or <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/releases/view/46046\">Prism v2.2</a>, you could be able to see an associated test project, as you mentioned.</p>\r\n<p>That said, for more information about unit testing, you could see the following links:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://perftestingguide.codeplex.com/\">patterns &amp; practices: Performance Testing Guidance for Web Applications</a> </li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pagtest/\">Patterns &amp; Practices Test</a> </li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlightut\">Silverlight Unit Test Framework</a> </li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182515(VS.90).aspx\">Working with Unit Tests</a> </li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163665.aspx\">Write Maintainable Unit Tests That Will Save You Time And Tears</a> </li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?culture=en-US&EventID=1032264221&CountryCode=US\">MSDN Architecture Webcast: patterns &amp; practices Live: Test Driven Development</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Additionally, as this question is not strictly related to Prism if you have more question about it, you could also use the&nbsp; <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/vsunittest/threads\">Visual Studio Unit Testing</a> forum.</p>\r\n<p>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>",

This assembly was included in Prism v2.2, and it provides a mock class of the Unity container for the purpose of facilitates the unit testing.
