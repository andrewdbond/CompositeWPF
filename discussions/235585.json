The KeepAlive and IsNavigationTarget need to return true for you to be able to navigate between views.</p>\r\n<p>IRegionMemberLifetime helps you decide whether you want to remove the deactivated view from the region or just mark it as decativated. IsNavigationTarget in INavigationAware helps you specify that the view can be naviagted to using the RequestNavigate.</p>\r\n<p>Try the above and let me know.</p>\r\n",
