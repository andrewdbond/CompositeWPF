Based on this you will have to decide if you will keep it or not. Also, note that if you have run the <strong>RegisterPrismBinaries.bat</strong> from&nbsp; <strong>Prism 4.1</strong> without the aforementioned modifications its probably that your past registered binaries for <strong>Silverlight 4</strong> may not work. But if you only run the batch with the modifications then your <strong>Prism 4.0</strong> registered binaries for <strong>Silverlight 4</strong> should remain the same.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>",
