Think that i'm currently work on view1 on window1, and in the other window (window2) I worked before on view6 (it is in focus on window2).</p>\r\n<p>Now, when i'm leaving view1 on window1 to view2 on window1 i got the lost focus and the get focus of this 2 views. But... when I' leaving to view6 on the other window i don't get the lost focus!!!!!</p>\r\n<p>That's because in window1 I'm still working on view2 (it has the focus but the window isn't active). but now, if I'm going to run the composite command, it will execute 2 commands, one of the view2 and the second is of view6. That's not what i wanted!!!</p>\r\n<p>maybe i need to listen to active event on the windows?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for the help</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
