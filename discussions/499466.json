    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Prism for WPF / Silverlight</strong> is a client-side library oriented to manage UI composition, modules and comunication between loosely coupled components in the client.\r<br />\nIt does not provide any functionality as out of the box to communicate or interact with data sources, web services or other external resources. That being said, Prism does not provide any build-in mechanism for caching data.\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever you can create your own <strong>shared service</strong> that could manage your communication with the data base and the local cache. That service could be easily exported inside your Prism application so that it could be consumed by the corresponding components in each module.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou can find more information about creating and exporting services in the following chapter of the documentation:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921122%28v=pandp.40%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chapter 9 - Communicating Between Loosely Coupled Components</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nDamian Cherubini\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a><br />\n",
