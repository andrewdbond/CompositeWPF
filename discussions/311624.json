With Prism the Rad Outlook bar doesn't load at client machine where as the same works fine and excellent on development machine as well as in the project without prism.\r\n And it is observed that when a Silverlight development version is installed on the client machine, it again works fine. Is the Prism 4, Rad OutlookBar dependent on the Silverlight Development version? Telerik says there might be some problem with Prism, and\r\n if so, is there any way out to get rid of the developer version on the client machine, here we can't force our clients to install Developer, please get me out out this tricky situation.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Thanks and Regards,</div>\r\n<div>Syed Danish</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",
