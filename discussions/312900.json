My xaml is similar to that below, I think I need to implement IDataErrorInfo in the\r\n view model (my button commands are split out into separate files from the view model and I'm not sure if that is the best thing to do or not). I have tried implementing IDataErrorInfo, and I can't seem to get it to validate.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>  &lt;Button Command=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;{Binding ShowModuleAppConflictSearchResults}&quot;</span> Content=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;Search&quot;</span> Grid.Row=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;2&quot;</span> Height=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;23&quot;</span>  Margin=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;0,28,12,0&quot;</span> Name=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;btnSearch&quot;</span> VerticalAlignment=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;Top&quot;</span> Width=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;75&quot;</span> HorizontalAlignment=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;Right&quot;</span>&gt;\r\n         \r\n            &lt;Button.CommandParameter&gt;\r\n                &lt;MultiBinding Converter=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;{StaticResource conflictSearchConverter}&quot;</span> &gt;\r\n                    &lt;Binding Path=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;Text&quot;</span> ElementName=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;txtone&quot;</span>  <span style=\"color:#a31515\"></span> &gt;&lt;/Binding&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Binding Path=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;Text&quot;</span> ElementName=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;txttwo&quot;</span>/&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Binding Path=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;Text&quot;</span> ElementName=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;txtthree&quot;</span>/&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Binding Path=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;Text&quot;</span> ElementName=<span style=\"color:#a31515\">&quot;date&quot;</span>&gt;&lt;/Binding&gt;\r\n                &lt;/MultiBinding&gt;\r\n            &lt;/Button.CommandParameter&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n        &lt;/Button&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>Thanks Agustin!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After re-reading chapter 5 (and much swearing as the code quotes there seemed to be silverlight only!) I took the Commanding QuickStart to bits and put it back together again to see if I could get mine working.&nbsp; This helped with 3 of the four fields that needed validation, which are text boxes.&nbsp; The fourth was a little more interesting - the control to be validated is a date picker, so getting the xaml styling correct to outline it on error took a bit of digging into the documentation on the MSDN website to find out&nbsp; about validation error templates.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I suspect I've kind of used a sledge hammer to crack a nut - like the quick start sample I use a delegate command to check if things are indeed valid, and I then go on to call another command from there to move on and carry out my search.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks once again</p>",
