Need help in a problem with the <strong>RegionNames.MainRegion</strong> content using the <strong>&lt;Controls:AnimatedTabControl.../&gt;</strong>.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Problem:</strong><br />\nWhen you have only one <em>Tabitem</em> - <strong>StockTraderRI.Modules.Position</strong> it doesn't show.  To test this, just comment out the &quot;<strong>WatchModule</strong>&quot; in the <strong>StockTraderRIBootstrapper</strong> from being added to the <strong>ModuleCatalog</strong> to see what I'm talking about.<br />\n<br />\nHow do you activate the one <strong>Tabitem</strong> - <strong>StockTraderRI.Modules.Position</strong> to be focused and visible?<br />\n<br />\nThanks!...<br />\n",

After commenting the <strong>WatchModule</strong>, the <strong>PositionModule</strong> was still being added correctly to the <strong>AnimatedTabControl</strong>.\r<br />\n<br />\nPerhaps, you could try using the <strong>AnimatedTabControl</strong> included in the latest <strong>Prism</strong> version in your application instead of the <strong>Prism 2.0</strong> one.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\n<br />\nDamian Cherubini\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a><br />\n",

Yes, I did test the 4.1 before posting and it did work fine and I didn't make it clear I was referring to the Unity version.  I updated the control logic to the 4.1 and its working fine now! :)  Kewl!<br />\n<br />\nThanks for your help!...<br />\n",
