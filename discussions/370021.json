I have <strong>Silverlight_5_Toolkit_December_2011</strong>, and in order to install it,\r\n<strong>I guess I must have installed the Silverlight5_Toolbox first, right?</strong>\r\n</li><li>The Code-Plex page says that in order to see the 3D controls in the new toolbox, one must have installed the\r\n<strong>XNA Studio</strong>, <strong>what does it mean</strong>?, does it refer to\r\n<strong>XNAGS40_setup?,</strong> I downloaded it. </li><li>I also got into the Silverlight page and they suggest to download <strong>Silverlight.exe</strong>, What is tit?, Is it a more straightful way of installing Silverlight?. I'm using VS2010 which already comes with Silverlight 3,\r\n<p>I was trying to get help from the Silverlight Forum, but didn't get any.</p>\r\n<p>Would you please help me with it?</p>\r\n</li>",

    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>As far as I know in order to install the <strong>Silverlight 5</strong> development tools you should install the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691\">Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=229318\">Silverlight 5 Tools for Visual Studio 2010 SP1</a>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Then, if you also want to install the additional features for <strong>Silverlight</strong>, which also includes the 3d project templates, you could optionally install the\r\n<a href=\"http://silverlight.codeplex.com/\">Silverlight 5 Toolkit</a>.</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned in the note you commented, regarding the requirements needed in order to use the new Silverlight 3D templates, I believe you could find the following thread in the\r\n<strong>Silverlight </strong>forums useful:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://forums.silverlight.net/t/253957.aspx/1\">Silverlight 5 Toolkit December 2011. Lost project templates...</a>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Also, regarding the <strong>Silverlight.exe</strong> installer, I'm not sure if this is the one for you, as it is possible that this is the\r\n<strong>end-user runtime</strong> installer and developers should not install this on machines to be used for\r\n<strong>Silverlight </strong>development.</p>\r\n<p>Note that, you may find more information, better support and guidance on this topics in the\r\n<a href=\"http://forums.silverlight.net/\">Silverlight forums</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br>\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>\r\n",
