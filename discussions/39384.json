I read the readme and the documentation and didnt see anything extra I needed. When the silverlight test page loaded it only showed the stock list and that was it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've already seen other examples/source on the blogosphere but I'd like to get this one working to verify some assumptions that I have about the product. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks guys. <br>\r\n",
