I would have thought that I would be able to add the reference required to only the module in question and that none it wouldn't be required in the shell project. If it is truly modular and decoupled why would the scheel project need to know about the referenced dll in the module project?</p>\r\n<p>What are your thoughts?</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Darren.</p>",

At first, I thought that it was not a work-item, since I didn&rsquo;t realized that you need to add this to your Shell project for something required in your modules.<br><br>It means that if you add this assembly to your module (not shell), it throws an exception. Do you have a repro sample of this? I would like to open a work-item if it does not work as expected.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for reporting that.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero<br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>",
