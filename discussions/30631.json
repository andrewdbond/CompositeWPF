Commands in WPF do require a parameter as part of the ICommand interface. As far as making an UnparameterizedDelegateCommand which accepts delegates of type Action (parameterless) this makes sense though we won't get to it as we ship tomorrow :) It would probably be useful to put this into the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://codeplex.com/prismcontrib\">PrismContrib</a> project.\r\n",
