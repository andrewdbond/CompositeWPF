I know P&amp;P works in an agile way and heavily based on customer input. I also know that there're some projects that have evolved during the years like Enterprise Library and others that weren't that succesful. Before we start betting on this library I'd like to know what're the plans (if any) for the next versions of Prism. &nbsp;I'm specially concerned on the support for the next version of&nbsp;Silverlight that&nbsp;is going to be released soon and there're new pieces like Validation, Navigation, ChildWindows that might need to be covered by the Guidance in the form of documentation, libraries or new Region Adapters.&nbsp;</p>",
