AppMenu has buttons for &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;New Sale&quot;, &quot;New Order&quot;. New Sale is cash sale, New Order is a phone order that gets queued.<br />\n<br />\nMainRegion can contain the following views.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Home&quot; or &quot;New Sale&quot; or &quot;New Order&quot; views.<br />\n<br />\n&quot;Home&quot; is the main page and I call _regionManager.RequestNavigate to show the main page.<br />\n<br />\nWhen the user clicks New Order or New Sale button I use _regionManager.RequestNavigate to show the respective view in the main region.<br />\n<br />\nIn &quot;New Sale&quot; and &quot;New Order&quot; those views have unique fields that pertain to them. I also have a common product search control that I want to place in them. I am calling this control as &quot;ProductControl&quot;<br />\n<br />\nMy issue is how do I inject the ProductControl to show in &quot;New Sale&quot; or &quot;New Order&quot; using Unity as my container? <br />\n<br />\nWhen I use the regular way of &lt;controls:ProductControl /&gt; unity does not manage the life time. Also, the designer will complain that the control does not have a default constructor.<br />\n<br />\nI am using Prism 5. <br />\n<br />\nThanks for your time.<br />\n",
