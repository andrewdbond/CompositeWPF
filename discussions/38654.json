    "Html": "I have created an MDI application based on the library. The app has a data model, and a set of modules that work on the data model. The question I have is once the app is running and the data model is loaded and worked on, I decided to create a new &quot;document&quot;, at which point I want to clear the data model and remove all created objects, etc... What is the best way of synchronising the modules that are still attched to the model. Basically I need to tell the modules to remove any bindings to the data model and deactivate active views. I cannot use event notification to let the modules know, because that is a fire and forget. What mechanism do I use to wait to be certain that all modules have finished there tasks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo I use a composite command ?.. if so how do I set the initial state.<br>\r\n",
