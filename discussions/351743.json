    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>After we could mock the database and make the sample to run correctly, we found that the error you are experiencing is being caused by the fact that your <strong>OrderView </strong>and <strong>OrderDetailView </strong>(the one that host the <strong>RadDataGrid</strong>) are using <em><strong>two different instances of the same view model</strong></em>.</p>\r\n<p>The reason behind this is that the <strong>OrderViewModel </strong>is being exported with the attribute <strong>[PartCreationPolicy(CreationPolicy.NonShared)]</strong>. This means that each time this type is <strong><em>imported </em></strong>a different instance of the view model will be created. As both the <strong>OrderView </strong>and the <strong>OrderDetailView </strong>declare an import of type <strong>OrderViewModel </strong> in their code behind, each of the views will obtain a different instance of the view model.</p>\r\n<p>When you invoked the <strong>RaisePropertyChange </strong>method in the view model of the <strong>OrderView</strong>, the view was notified of the changes correctly. But as the <strong>OrderDetailView</strong> had a different view model, no changes in the data were performed and no notifications were raised to this view.</p>\r\n<p>If you wish to share the same view model between the two views, a possible approach could be to define the <strong>OrderViewModel</strong> as a singleton by changing the aforementioned attribute for this one: <strong>[PartCreationPolicy(CreationPolicy.Shared)].</strong> Another possible approach is to eliminate the <strong>ViewModel</strong> property and its <strong>Import </strong>attribute from the <strong>OrderDetailView</strong>'s code behind. The view then will inherit the view model of the <strong>OrderView</strong>. As a side note we have checked that both approaches seem to work correctly.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\" class=\"mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\"><strong>[PartCreationPolicy(CreationPolicy.NonShared)]</strong></div>",
