Create a Window inside a Module(Project with a CustomControl type conatins Module implementation) and divide it into subregions as it was done in a shell.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Dynamically load new Modules that will register views with a subregions of that new modal window.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Am I right?</p>\r\n<p>And I will be glad if someone can give me a sample of code how to implement that.</p>\r\n<p>With best wishes,</p>\r\n<p>Alexander.</p>",

You can check the  RegionPopupBehaviors in the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458919.aspx\">Reference  Implementation</a>. You can add subregions to popup windows shown  through this behavior, but you should be careful with <a href=\"../wikipage?title=Popup region throws error if the region it contains has an items control.&referringTitle=Known Issues / Fixes\">this  issue</a>.</p>\r\n<p id=446a6fd0-1339-012d-7078-123139061101>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p id=446a8840-1339-012d-7079-123139061101>Guido  Leandro Maliandi    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
