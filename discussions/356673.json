You could do this by manually adding items to the deployment project with the expected\r\n folder structure; as your module's project may not be a dependency of your main project, you might have to add it manually to the corresponding location in the\r\n<strong>Application folder</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>You could find more information on how to configure the <strong>Windows Installer\r\n</strong>in the following link:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/206sadcd\">Deployment Tasks and Walkthroughs</a>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br>\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>\r\n",
