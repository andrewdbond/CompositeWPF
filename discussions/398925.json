    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>As described in the exception, the problem you are experiencing is that there is no <strong>RegionAdapter </strong>registered for the type <strong>DockPanel</strong>. This is because <strong>Prism </strong>does not support <strong>Regions </strong>based on <strong>DockPanels </strong>as out of the box.</p>\r\n<p>Basically, when setting a control as a <strong>Region</strong>, <strong>Prism </strong>will search inside its <strong>RegionAdapterMappings </strong>in order to find a <strong>RegionAdapter </strong>that is suitable for that control. As out of the box, <strong>Prism </strong>provides <strong>RegionAdapters </strong>for the following types:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>SelectorRegionAdapter</strong>: To create <strong>Regions </strong>based on controls that inherit from the <strong>Selector </strong>class.</li>\r\n<li><strong>ItemsControlRegionAdapter</strong>: To create <strong>Regions </strong>based on controls that inherit from the <strong>ItemsControl </strong>class.</li>\r\n<li><strong>ContentControlRegionAdapter</strong>: To create <strong>Regions </strong>based on controls that inherit from the <strong>ContentControl </strong>class.</li>\r\n<li><strong>TabControlRegionAdapter</strong>: To create Regions based on <strong>TabControls </strong>(only in <strong>Silverlight</strong>, in <strong>WPF </strong>this adapter is not required.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>As the <strong>DockPanel </strong>controls does not inherit from any of the aforementioned controls, <strong>Prism </strong>does not have a <strong>RegionAdapter </strong>for it, and the aforementioned exception is raised. In order to use a <strong>DockPanel </strong>as a region, you would need to develop your own custom <strong>RegionAdapter </strong>from it and register it in <strong>RegionAdaptersMappings</strong>. You can find more information about <strong>RegionAdapters </strong>in the following section of Prism's documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430866%28v=pandp.40%29.aspx#sec25\">Appendix E: Extending Prism - Region Adapters</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
