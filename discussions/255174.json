You could have your Shell subscribe to an event through the event aggregator, so that it calls its Close method when that event is published.</p>\r\n<p>The general recommended practice would be to place the responsibility of carrying out the validation on a component placed on a module, and load other modules based on the result of that validation. However, the decision of where to place it depends mostly on the specific conditions of your security validation.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
