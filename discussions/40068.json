I've tried to figure our why by comparing the differences between my application and the StockTrader application. My application is required to be in VB... I'm using VS 2008 and .Net 3.5 SP1.<br>\r\n Is there something one should add in VB which is not part of the stock trader sample?<br>\r\nwhat could be other possible reasons for the presenter.view to return as nothing in CreateShell?<br>\r\nThank you,<br>\r\nKen \r\n",
