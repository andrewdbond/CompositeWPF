As a way to get commanding functionality in <strong>Silverlight</strong> (and also enable the use of commands for elements other than buttons in WPF &amp; Silverlight), you can use Attached Behaviors.</p>\r\n<p id=f1a20c00-a5ec-012c-ecf2-12313b015e31>You can find detailed explanation of all the above in <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/jdominguez/2008/08/icommand-for-silverlight-with-attached-behaviors/\">this post</a> by <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/jdominguez/\">Julian Dominguez</a>.</p>\r\n<p id=f1a22560-a5ec-012c-ecf3-12313b015e31>Prism provides out-of-the-box, an attached behavior to enable Buttons click in <strong>Silverlight</strong>. You can read about this in <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458928.aspx\">this article</a> from the Prism documentation.</p>\r\n<p id=f1a24570-a5ec-012c-ecf4-12313b015e31>Some time ago, I <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/2009/08/13/c-code-snippet-to-create-commands-with-attached-behaviors-using-prism/\">created a code snippet</a> which is really useful for creating commands with attached behaviors, and added it to a <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/2009/09/07/composite-application-guidance-for-wpf-sl-prism-v2-c-snippets-with-guidance-links-and-tips/\">Prism &ldquo;snippet kit&rdquo;</a>. You might find it useful when starting to implement your own commanding functionality.</p>\r\n<p id=f1a26cf0-a5ec-012c-ecf5-12313b015e31>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p id=f1a29230-a5ec-012c-ecf6-12313b015e31>Damian Schenkelman    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>",
