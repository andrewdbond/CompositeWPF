Some of them work in XP edition differently than in Vista. Try to turn off your virus protection for this and see if that helps. If it does look for an update from your virus protection provider. Before you turn it off run full virus scan as MSVCR80.dll (C runtime library) on your platform could be included or replaced by some of your previus installations and could contain a virus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span><span><span style=\"font-family:calibri\"></span><span style=\"font:7pt 'times new roman'\"></span></span><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">2. Do you have all windows updates applied to your platform? There are some KB articles related to cscript.exe and BEX error event that are reported after SP1, for example </span><a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/951978\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/951978</span></a><span style=\"font-family:calibri\"> this error (a different exception code) is expected when the language locale that you configured differs from the language of the operating system installed.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">Regards,<br>\r\nAlexander</span></p>\r\n",

Using multiple increases workload and can cause confusion between each other. Most 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party anti-virus programs turns off windows defender when 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party provider is installed, or at least my McAfee does it.  If AVG doesn’t do it, you should disable Windows Defener in Control Panel. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">Begin of my x64 vista edition journey I had a lot of problems with McAfee Virus Protection until they made the x64 engine working correctly. I often encountered wired errors while installing or using the software on x64 edition with McAfee.  As I also have x32 environment I often saw that the error was only encountered in x64 edition and stack was always pointing to McAfee.  </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">Anyhow, my recommendation is that you first install your antivirus program again, check AVG if they have any updates for x64 edition available, and then turn off Windows Defender.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">If this does not help you need to raise a support request and follow the support guidelines of your anti-virus provider.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">Let me know if disabling the Windows Defender solved the problem.  </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">Regards,<br>\r\nAlexander</span></p>\r\n",
