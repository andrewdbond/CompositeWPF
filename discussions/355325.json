    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>Based on my understanding, due to the nature of the <strong>App.config</strong> file it's not possible to reference a constant defined in your application inside the aforementioned file. This can be seen in the <strong>Modularity QuickStart</strong>, which define the module names using constants in the <strong>WellKnownModuleNames </strong>static class but needs to write the corresponding module names in the <strong>App.config</strong> file.</p>\r\n<p>As this is not strictly related to Prism, I believe you can find more information about the <strong>App.config</strong> file and better support regarding this topic as well in the <strong>WPF</strong> forums:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/wpf/threads\">Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) Forums</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Regards,<br /><br />Damian Cherubini<br /><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
