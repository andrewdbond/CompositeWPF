    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi Saheer,</p>\r\n<p>Based on my understanding, your issue is caused because the <strong>IEventAggregator\r\n</strong>type mapping isn't in place when you try to resolve it. In order for the Unity Container to resolve an IEventAggregator, a type mapping to a concrete type (the EventAggregator concrete class, in this case) is needed, since an interface by itself cannot\r\n be constructed.</p>\r\n<p>The mapping might not be there because:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You're trying to resolve the IEventAggregator before the UnityBootstrapper has registered the type mapping, or\r\n</li><li>you're not using the same instance fo the Unity Container that has been used to register the type mapping.\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>If you continue experiencing the same situation, it would be useful if you could provide more information about your view, and when and how it is created.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful,</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>\r\n",
