How can I add 3 instances of the same view to regionmanager? If I try to do this, I get an exception that&nbsp;an instance of the view already exists in the collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Additionally, I think that you can find interesting that the API reference of Phone is part of the latest drop (9) of Prism. You can download it from <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/releases/view/53420\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>",
