After doing this I have a FileNotFound error when one of the modules is loaded into memory (in module catalog it has InitializationMode set to WhenAvailable). When I add this dll to Shell everything is ok but I don’t want this dll in shell. It looks like this dll is not loaded when module is loading – is there any way to fix this?\r<br />\n<br />\nPs. Copy Local is set to true in this module.<br />\n",
