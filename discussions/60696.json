This can result in an ActiveAware view not being informed it is active since the ActiveAware behaviour hasn&rsquo;t been attached to the region at the point where the view is created and added to the region.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 10pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri;font-size:small\">Changing the code to add the RegionActiveAwareBehavior ahead of the AutoPopulateRegionBehavior fixes the problem described.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif';font-size:11pt\">I haven&rsquo;t looked into how the other behaviors interact so I&rsquo;m interested in the reason for the current order and any known problems that could be created by changing the order.</span></p>",
