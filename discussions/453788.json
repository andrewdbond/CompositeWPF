    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nBased on the scenario you described us, there wouldnâ€™t be any special considerations for this to run. As far as I know, <strong>OnNavigatedFrom</strong> and <strong>OnNavigatedTo</strong> shouldn't be the cause of the problem if the navigation does not occurs. However, I think you should verify the following:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Requests[i].RegionName and Requests[i].ViewName exist and are correctly spelled as equals to its registration name.</li>\n<li>The views are correctly registered in your Container.</li>\n<li>\nThe Request.Navigate call from the second view is executed.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nAlso, take into account that the <strong>Navigation API</strong> swallows any type of exception so any issue regarding the navigation won't be output. Therefore, if you need to know if there is an exception in your navigation, you can subscribe to the <strong>IRegionNavigationServiceNavigationFailed</strong> event to get more details.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou may also find helpful the following thread:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/452384\" rel=\"nofollow\">View Base Navigation not taking place</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nIf that doesn't help you, it would be helpful if you can provide us with additional information on how the <strong>Navigate</strong> requests and the <strong>OnNavigatedTo</strong> and <strong>OnNavigatedFrom</strong> methods are implemented. \r<br />\n<br />\nHope this helps,\r<br />\n<br />\nFederico Martinez \r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez</a> <br />\n",
