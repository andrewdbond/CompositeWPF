Maybe I'm missing something obvious.&nbsp; It would be so much simpler to just create a Core library of these and just statically reference the services core objects.</p>\r\n<p>How can I create a simple library for the contracts that can also be shared accross the wire?&nbsp; Any pointers on this would be great.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>James</p>",
