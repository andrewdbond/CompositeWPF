    "Html": "<p>Hi Damian,</p>\r\n<p>I think I found a bug that originates from the original code from the postings about how to open multiple dialog boxes (as opposed to the shared/reused dialogbox in the Reference Implementation).&nbsp; It can best be demonstrated in the sample code you sent back to me by clicking &quot;Show Button 1 Window&quot;, then closing the button&nbsp;1 stuff&nbsp;window, then clicking &quot;Show Button 1 Window&quot; again.&nbsp; You should get a null reference exception in the Views_CollectionChanged event in DialogActivationBehavior.cs on the statement&nbsp;&quot;this.contentDialogs.ForEach(w =&gt; this.Region.Deactivate(w.Content));&quot; because w.Content is null.&nbsp; It seems that whenever a dialogbox is closed the view contained in it is destroyed but nothing ever removes the window from the contentDialogs collection.&nbsp; I think this is solved by adding &quot;this.contentDialogs.Remove(contentDialog);&quot; to the end of the CloseContentDialog method as in:</p>\r\n<pre>  private void CloseContentDialog(IWindow contentDialog)\r\n        {\r\n            if (contentDialog != null)\r\n            {\r\n                contentDialog.Closed -= this.ContentDialogClosed;\r\n                contentDialog.Close();\r\n                contentDialog.Content = null;\r\n                contentDialog.Owner = null;\r\n                this.contentDialogs.Remove(contentDialog);  // &lt;==== add this line\r\n            }\r\n        }</pre>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Can you confirm if my code change is the appropriate one?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Glenn</p>",
