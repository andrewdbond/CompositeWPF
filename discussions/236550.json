I can't use the ViewSortHintAttribute since I'm creating some of the views at runtime. I'm adding items to a toolbar that has been marked as a region.\r\n So for instance, I'm adding views that are derived from Buttons, etc, plus I'm creating new instances of separators and adding them in between my derived views.</p>\r\n<p>The documentation doesn't include much help and I've searched for hours online and so far I haven't found anyone who explains how to do this. How do I do this?</p>\r\n",
