I also have the entire Prism library downloaded on my computer (because I used just directly add the references to my projects before NuGet). My question is, when debugging, I would like to step into\r\n Prism source to have a better idea of what's going on. What is the best way to accomplish this? Should I just add the Prism projects to my solution and add references that way? I'd hate to have to re-structure my references, but if it's the only way, then\r\n that's what I'll do.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!!</p>\r\n",
