I want to have a common or shared or singleton model which can be passed across this view models and save at the end.... users can click on any link any navigation at any time and it should save data in to this\r\n singleton model expsosed through different view model. Do you have any samples which are doing something like this... or can you type up a quick one on how to do it? OR it is not possible to do it at all. I am following all patterns from your Pluralsight Video\r\n for PRISM so try to use that way....</p>\r\n<p>Samir Barot</p>\r\n",
