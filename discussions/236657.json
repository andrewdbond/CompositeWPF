When one of the services is instantiated I need to call a WCF service that retrieves some data before the application can continue. Here is the scenario. Application starts\r\n -&gt; types are registered in container -&gt; module downloaded -&gt; two data binding to view model -&gt; within view model get service instance -&gt; ask for data. The problem is how do I stop the UI from hanging whilst I wait for the data from the service.</p>\r\n<p>The reason I need this is the service checks to see if there is any saved data on the server to 'pre-fill' the form with data. If I can't call the service this way, can I call the service from application start-up; I tried this too within configure container\r\n but again the application hung. I tried to use a ManualResetEvent.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Ron.</p>\r\n",
