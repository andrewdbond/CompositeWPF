The xap's get downloaded and everything is fine.</p>\r\n<p>My application allows the user to close the container where the external xap gets downloaded. On closing I want to remove the DeploymentCatalog frm the AggregateCatalog. But the moment I call AggregateCatalog.Remove(DeploymentCatalog) it tries to recompose\r\n all the exports in it. I don't understand why it tries to recompose while removing the catalog. I'm having to do inline instantiations of the view models in the xap to get around this.</p>\r\n<p>Is this a desired behavior or is it a bug?</p>\r\n",
