A common place where you would bring WCF into a Prism application is through registering it with the container. As to stability, these are interim builds, and things arer still subject to change. We should be shipping the final by end of June.<br /><br />As to using it in a real product, we consider Prism guidance, that guidance is for a specific set of scenarios which is presented in our Reference Implementation. If your scenarios match those then Prism is the right fit. In our documentation that ships with Prism, we will have a good amount of content on waht applications are right for Prism and which ones are not.<br /><br />If you download the latest source, you will see we have a CHM file that has a Prism overview section. Although not finalized, it paints a pretty good picture about what Prism is built to address at a high level.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Glenn<br />",
