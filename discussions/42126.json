It seems that the UnityBootstrapper adds the container to itself (see <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/CompositeWPF/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=2862\" title=\"Composite WPF Issue\">this post</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy next attempt will be to, instead of disposing the container, publish an event ApplicationExit which any module may subscribe to. Anyone have an opinion of this, or a better idea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Wouldn't it be nice to have an IModule.Close method?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards<br>\r\nFredrik\r\n",

Can you please provide a bit more info of what resources you need to close, and what do you mean by closing resources before GC collecting the works?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou cannot dispose the root Prism unity container, or you can but you application will be gone as well and stack overflow exception is expected in this case. Also even if you would manage to get notification before GC, you would not be able to obtain the reference for your object as the GC would not collect it f there would be references. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyhow, if you can provide a bit more info of what you want to accomplish... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\nAlexander \r\n",

    "Html": "I'll gladly provide more info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy issue is that I have a WCF service which uses uses stateful semantics. My module calls the service which creates a computationally expensive report assigning it a certain report id. My module will call the service several times to access various parts of the report. When my module won't need the report it should call a service method <span style=\"font-size:13px\">\r\n<p>CloseStatusPeriodsReport(reportId);</p>\r\n</span> in order to free memory from the service. Specifically, when the applicaiton exits, the service method should be called. The service is shared between many clients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nThe service design is of course not the primary choice one would make but for performance reasons we had to make some sacrifices.</p>\r\n<p>By the way: Calling the service method from the finalizer won't work because apparently it will use an already disposed object, resulting in an ObjectDisposedException.</p>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\nFredrik\r\n",
