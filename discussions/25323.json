    "Html": "\r\nThe idea behind the queue is that we want to have a snapshot of all the registered commands at one point in time (specifically when you call Execute on the dispatcher command). The registered commands' list could be changed as a consequence of executing a particular command, so it's not enough to just iterate through the list of commands and call Execute on each.<br />Anyway, we didn't take into account that the Queue ctor may not be thread safe, so we may need a lock or something of the sort.<br /><br />Thank you for your feedback.<br />Julian Dominguez<br />",
