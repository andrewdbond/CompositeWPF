However, after checking the article you mentioned, I believe you should be able to apply the concepts described in a Prism application without problems.</p>\r\n<p>Based on my understanding, the only apparent different when using Prism would be that the view and view model would be resolved through the container. As this doesn't seem to interfere with the logic described in the aforementioned blog post you could use the same view and view model.</p>\r\n<p>In the following link you can find a modified version of the <strong>Hello World Quickstart</strong>, which includes the code snippets provided in the aforementioned blog post, under the name <strong>Prism with BackgroundWorker.zip</strong>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=99307b6105bc060d&amp;resid=99307B6105BC060D!107&amp;parid=99307B6105BC060D!101&amp;authkey=!ACgbDT5tLxt8pNk\">Prism with BackgroundWorker.zip</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
