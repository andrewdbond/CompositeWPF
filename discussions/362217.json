    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>From our side, I am able to debug the <strong>UI Composition QuickStart</strong> without problems; which leads me to believe that this is related to the configuration of your <strong>Visual Studio</strong> / <strong>QuickStart </strong>solution.</p>\r\n<p>As a starting point, you could try the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Check if <strong>Silverlight </strong>code debugging is enabled in your <strong>QuickStart </strong>solution. To do this, right-click on the <strong>UIComposition.Web</strong> project and select <strong>Properties</strong>. In the <strong>Web </strong>tab, the <strong>Silverlight </strong>check box under the <strong>Debuggers </strong>group should be checked in order to enable <strong>Silverlight </strong>code debugging.</li>\r\n<li>Try cleaning the solution, deleting the <strong>obj </strong>and <strong>Bin </strong>folders of each project and delete the .<strong>XAP </strong>files in the <strong>ClientBin </strong>folder of the <strong>Web</strong> project.</li>\r\n<li>Try removing and re-adding the <strong>Silverlight </strong>projects to the <strong>Web </strong>project. To do this, right-click on the <strong>UIComposition.Web</strong> project and select <strong>Properties</strong>. In the <strong>Silverlight Applications</strong> tab, remove both projects and then add them again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I hope this helps,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
