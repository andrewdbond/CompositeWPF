In regards to Commands, we can see how it works with a Button or other controls where the Command property is actually a dependency property, which allows for easy binding. However, we have run into a bit of a problem with the KeyBinding which we added to the InputBindings property on a TextBox because its Command property is not a DependencyProperty and does not allow bindings.<br /><br />Any ideas?<br />",
