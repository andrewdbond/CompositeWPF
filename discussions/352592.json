    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>You can find a very simple example of how to register a view to be injected in a region (using the <strong>RegisterViewWithRegion </strong>method) in the <strong>Hello World QuickStart</strong> provided with <strong>Prism</strong>. Also, you can compare your application against this <strong>QuickStart </strong>to check if there is any missing code required to start-up a <strong>Prism </strong>application.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding the code snippet you posted, I am a bit confused about what you are trying to accomplish in the following line:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: white;\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color: blue;\">this</span>.container.RegisterType&lt;IUnityContainer&gt;(<span style=\"color: blue;\">new</span> ContainerControlledLifetimeManager());\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\nAs far as I know, this sentence is not required to inject a view in a region and might even cause an unexpected behavior in your application.</p>\r\n<p>Based on your description of the problem, it seems that the container cannot compose the <strong>ucanvas </strong>type. As far as I know, this can be caused by several reasons. So, if the aforementioned suggestions were not useful to help you solve this problem, you can provide us with your sample application so that we take and look at it and help you further with this.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
