I searched on the net for this common issue but I didn't find a &quot;clear&quot; solution.</p>\r\n<p>I was thinking of two ways to do it:</p>\r\n<p>- In the intialize fonction of each module, read a section (<strong>GetSection</strong>) of the app.config file using the\r\n<strong>ConfigurationManager </strong>class. The only thing that bothers me with this approach is: when a new module is added to the application, the configuration file should be changed in order to add a new section. It doesn't seem as flexible as it should\r\n be.</p>\r\n<p>-Have a separate configuration file for each module and read it using the <strong>\r\nConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration</strong> method. Thus, when a new module is deployed, it comes with its configuration file (same name as the module).</p>\r\n<p>I have a preference for the second approach but it may not be the good one.</p>\r\n<p>What are your thoughts on all this?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Best,</p>\r\n",
