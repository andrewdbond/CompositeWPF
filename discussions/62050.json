You could <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458912.aspx\">register</a> a service that wraps the instances of the collections<span style=\"color:#1f497d\"> </span>in the container used by your application (Unity by default), and access them from the different modules.</p>\r\n<p>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p>Damian Schenkelman<br><span style=\"font-size:11pt\" lang=EN-US><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></span></p>",
