    "Html": "Hi Mathius,\r<br />\n<br />\nFirst, there would not be neccessary to use <strong>RegisterViewWithRegion</strong> before executing <strong>Navigation</strong>. If the <strong>View</strong> you would like to <strong>Navigate</strong> to is not previously registered, then the <strong>Region</strong> would add it to its <strong>View</strong> list. And in order to prevent activation of <strong>Views</strong> when they would get registered, you could use the Region's <strong><em>Add()</em></strong> method.\r<br />\nMoreover, for the <strong><em>OnNavigatedFrom()</em></strong> and <strong><em>OnNavigatedTo()</em></strong> methods getting called, they <strong>ViewModel</strong> would need to implement <strong>INavigationAware</strong> interface. This way, the <strong>INavigationAware</strong> <strong>ViewModels</strong> are resolved when navigation occurs, and its <strong><em>OnNavigatedFrom()</em></strong> method is called.\r<br />\n<br />\nBased on my understanding, the &quot;<em>MyViewModelBase&quot;</em> class would be implementing <strong>INavigationAware</strong> so the <strong><em>OnNavigatedFrom()</em></strong> method is called. But what derived types would you need for calling?\r<br />\n<br />\nYou can find more information about <strong><em>View-Switching Navigation</em></strong> in the following <strong>MSDN Prism Guide</strong> chapter:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430861(v=pandp.40).aspx#sec6\" rel=\"nofollow\">View Based Navigation</a></li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430861(v=pandp.40).aspx#sec9\" rel=\"nofollow\">View and View Model Participation in Navigation</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nI hope this helped you,\r<br />\nRegards.\r<br />\n<br />\nGabriel Ostrowsky\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blogs.southworks.net/gostrowsky</a><br />\n",
