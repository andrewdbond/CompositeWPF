I can add a stock to the watch list, and I can click on a stock in the position list view to view it's historical information.<br>\r\n   When I look through the code in the modules, there seems to be a lot more functionality in there, and it seem like the other buttons (Submit, Cancel, Submit All, Cancel All) should be getting enabled at some point as it seems like there's code for all of this.<br>\r\n    Is there something I'm missing from the perspective of the user of this application, or perhaps is some of this still being wired together?<br>\r\n   Thanks,<br>\r\n<br>\r\njeff\r\n",

    "Html": "Hey Damian,<br>\r\n  Thanks for the reply. This might be a pure usability issue, and not technical at all.<br>\r\n   I'm actually working with the WPF project, not the silverlight one. I went ahead and removed the silverlight project. I've also removed the test project, and then built (for me the build fails with the test projects perhaps because I don't have a team server, not sure).  <br>\r\n   The build succeeds and the app runs fine, but the only &quot;active&quot; button in the MainToolbarRegion is the &quot;Add To Watchlist&quot; button.<br>\r\n   I first tried adding any stock name, which didn't do anything, then tried one similar to the others in the list (such as STOCK1) and then I was able to add it to the watch list, however, at no point do any of the other buttons become active. Perhaps I'm just missing something about how to use the demo.<br>\r\n   I'd be interested to see if anyone else has had luck running this.<br>\r\n   I'm using the one from code drop 7.<br>\r\n   Thanks,<br>\r\nJeff\r\n",
