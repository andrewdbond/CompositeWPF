In the userguide, it is said that the purpose of Shellpresenter is &quot;Any logic for the shell presentation is handled by the shell presenter&quot;. It basically highlights the seperated presentation pattern.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The Ishellview is in a seperate class file. The bootstrapper file ,i tried the following method helps to create a shell with out using shelpresenter and it works.</p>\r\n<p>protected override DependencyObject CreateShell()<br>{<br>&nbsp; IShellView prent = Container.Resolve&lt;IShellView&gt;();<br>&nbsp; prent.ShowView();&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; return prent&nbsp; as DependencyObject; <br>}</p>\r\n<p>As prism speaks about modular programming and if all the business logics are maintained in the respective modules, am amazed what logic the shell presenter&nbsp;could contain ? . Is it really needed to keep the shellpresenter..?</p>\r\n<p>Pls advice</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>Devasena</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

As explained in <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff650616.aspx\">this  article</a>, since most of the application&rsquo;s functionality and content  is provided by modules, the shell has minimal capability. But that  doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t have any logic at all.</p>\r\n<p id=8c235c00-4f09-012d-d647-1231390e6401>In those scenarios in which it  has some presentation logic, it is preferable to have a Shell  Presenter, to apply the separate presentation patterns.</p>\r\n<p id=8c237ef0-4f09-012d-d648-1231390e6401>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p id=8c239ea0-4f09-012d-d649-1231390e6401>Guido Leandro Maliandi     <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
