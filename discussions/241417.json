That being said, I did like DevExpress and would be happy to use it again\r\n (plus this was a year ago now - I haven't touched .NET/wpf since unfortunately and so I might be a bit out of date on this).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>DevExpress &amp; Infragistics both provide fancy UI layout controls and docking managers and I was wondering how well this works with some of the Prism ideas like regions? Can I build a nice base application using their docking managers and then write modules\r\n that load their screens into them easily enough?</p>\r\n<p>What are your experiences with these tools and can you recommend others that are worth me looking at?</p>\r\n<p>Any thoughts and advice would be appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>David</p>\r\n",
