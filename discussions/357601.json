If we update the Infragistics version we have to compile all the modules in order to use the updated version (We don&rsquo;t want our module to re-compile for updation of version).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;2. Suppose we have multiple modules loaded in a shell and all those modules are using Infragistics version x.xx, and we add a new module that is using Infragistics version y.yy. If we run the application, it crashes b/c of two separate versions of\r\n Infragistics being used among the modules.</p>\r\n<p>Any suggestion about this scenario ?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>Regarding you first issue, based on my understanding, by default, when you run the application, the runtime attempts to bind with the exact version of an assembly that the module was built with.</p>\r\n<p>You could find more information about this in the following <strong>MSDN </strong>\r\narticle:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7wd6ex19.aspx\">Redirecting Assembly Versions</a>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Take into account that, as far as I know, currently <strong>Prism </strong>does not provide guidance on how to achieve changing your referenced assembly version without recompiling the module's assembly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, I believe you could find the following links interesting:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430856%28v=pandp.40%29\">11: Deploying Prism Applications</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405497%28v=pandp.40%29\">WPF Prism Deployment Hands-On Lab: Publishing and Updating with ClickOnce</a>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Regarding, your second concern, you will have to avoid having two separate versions of the same\r\n<strong>dll</strong>. For example you could ensure that this common <strong>dll </strong>\r\nis in only one location (e.g. setting <strong>Copy Local</strong> = <strong>False\r\n</strong>and placing the <strong>dll </strong>in the application folder), this way when you update the application you will replace your assembly with your new one, although you will still have to solve the first issue you mentioned.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br>\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>\r\n",
