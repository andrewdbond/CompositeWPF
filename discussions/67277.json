Another possible option is using <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/jdominguez/2008/08/icommand-for-silverlight-with-attached-behaviors/\">commands with attached behaviors</a> (you can use <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/2009/08/13/c-code-snippet-to-create-commands-with-attached-behaviors-using-prism/\">this code snippet</a> to create the attached behavior).</p>\r\n<p>You can download a small sample application from <a href=\"http://cid-09f63fc7ac065e5e.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/p|0p Samples/KeyDownSample.zip\">here</a>, using attached behaviors. Take into account that for this to work, the window/view where you want this to work must have <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.iinputelement.iskeyboardfocused.aspx\">KeyboardFocus</a> (you can check this by having a textbox in the view and focusing on it).</p>\r\n<p>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p>Damian Schenkelman <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>",
