I have implemented a splash screen from the bootstrapper and want to provide the user with module info (as they are loaded) while the module manager is loading the app/modules.</p>\r\n<p>I think I need to subscribe to the LoadModuleCompleted event in the module manager. I cannot do this because when I resolve the module manager with the container in the MEF bootstrapper the PRISM framework calls OnImportsSatisfied which loads all the modules.\r\n (This is too late since I want to listen for this).</p>\r\n<p>How can I display a splash window with a progress bar displaying module info/progress?</p>\r\n<p>Many thanks!</p>\r\n",
