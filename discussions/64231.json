Tag such as Prism V1, V2, SL3 is not accurate, so these days I browsed&nbsp;out Discussions, I found all the questions focus on these points as follow:</p>\r\n<p>1.Event</p>\r\n<p>2.Command</p>\r\n<p>3.SL special Features</p>\r\n<p>3.RegionManager and RegionViewRegistry</p>\r\n<p>4.Module Load</p>\r\n<p>5.Weak reference</p>\r\n<p>6.Communicate with others, like WCF, RIA, 3rd party componments</p>\r\n<p>7.RegionAdapter</p>\r\n<p>8.Behavior</p>\r\n<p>9.Bootstrapper</p>\r\n<p>10.RI</p>\r\n<p>11.MVP patterns</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Just a simple summury above.

These days I actually find some good Q & A(including my answers, <img height=19 alt=\"\" src=\"http://gfx2.hotmail.com/mail/w3/ltr/emoticons/smile_regular.gif\" width=19>).<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  And I had also send a email to Blaine.Wastell, but no response. In the letter I discuss the Prism experiences in detail, and also give some simple DEMO to illustrate concept. I think the Prism document is nod so good, so I even give a draft context of the new document.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  Additionally, the behavior is so simple and puzzled in Prism V2, I wonder how about it in V3.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\nRegards<br>\r\nJianqiang<br> <br>\r\n<hr id=stopSpelling>\r\nFrom: [email removed]<br>To: [email removed]<br>Date: Tue, 4 Aug 2009 09:52:09 -0700<br>Subject: Re: Suggettion to Prism forum [CompositeWPF:64231]<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: dschenkelman<br>\r\n<div id=\"EC_ThreadNotificationPostBody\">\r\nHi<br>\r\nThanks for the feedback!
