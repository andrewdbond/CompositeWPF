As neither the <strong>ModuleCatalog </strong>nor the <strong>ModuleManager </strong>provide any means of accessing the list of modules that have already been loaded (versus the modules that are just present in the catalog), the approach I'd follow for obtaining this would be to have a custom service that manages that, responding to the <strong>ModuleManager.LoadModuleCompleted</strong> event and using the <strong>ModuleCatalog.Modules</strong> enumeration to have a notion of the total of modules present in the catalog.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
