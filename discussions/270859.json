I wanted MVVM Pattern, Event Aggregator, and Dynamic XAP Loading etc.</p>\r\n<p>I based my application on the Application Developed by John papa <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">\r\nPrim.Demo.UI</span> Solution.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://johnpapa.net/pdc-09-advanced-topics-for-building-large-scale-applications-with-microsoft-silverlight\">http://johnpapa.net/pdc-09-advanced-topics-for-building-large-scale-applications-with-microsoft-silverlight</a></p>\r\n<p>I got into Some Problem like.</p>\r\n<p>In the Screen Presentation Framework the ViewModel &amp; View Constructor is called once and it never gets called if a user clicks the same screen again from the Menu It just gets Visible in the Region again.</p>\r\n<p>this.ViewModel = Container.Resolve&lt;IPortfolioCreateViewModel&gt;();<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.View = Container.Resolve&lt;PortfolioCreateView&gt;();<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.View.DataContext = this.ViewModel;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now I am not sure how can I send a data from One Module to another?</p>\r\n<p>I wrote a separate Utils Class in the Infrastructure to share the data between the Modules.</p>\r\n<p>I also cannot pass a ViewModel Object to the View&rsquo;s constructor as I wanted to acess ViewModel methods from View Code Behind as well.</p>\r\n<p>I needed some ways to resolve these things.</p>\r\n<p>I tried to post this in the Silverlight Forum, they suggested to ask suggestions from prism team.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://forums.silverlight.net/t/237689.aspx/1?Pass&#43;values&#43;from&#43;View1&#43;of&#43;Module1&#43;to&#43;another&#43;View2&#43;of&#43;Module2&#43;and&#43;opening&#43;that&#43;View2&#43;in&#43;Prism\">http://forums.silverlight.net/t/237689.aspx/1?Pass&#43;values&#43;from&#43;View1&#43;of&#43;Module1&#43;to&#43;another&#43;View2&#43;of&#43;Module2&#43;and&#43;opening&#43;that&#43;View2&#43;in&#43;Prism</a></p>\r\n<p>May be I am not able to use Event Aggregators Properly.</p>\r\n<p>Regards</p>\r\n<p>Debashish Gupta.</p>\r\n",
