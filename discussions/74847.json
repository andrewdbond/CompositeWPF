This means the third part applications need to open my WPF composite window on the top of others and disable to access others until it close.</p>\r\n<p>I tried to use the ShowDialog to open the main composite window. Unfortunately looks the composite regions havenot been activated (the region adaptors didnot work at all).</p>\r\n<p>Any idea?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Looks it's a silly question. Just realized the ShowDialog() would not return so the CAL would not load the regions through adaptors. That's the reason. I withdraw my question.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks all</p>",
