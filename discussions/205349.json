    "Html": "<p>Hi Zaheer,</p>\r\n<p>There is no documentation specific to the  <strong>RegionPopupBehavior</strong>, as it is not part of the CAL. Instead it  is located in the Behaviors folder, inside the  <strong>StockTraderRI.Infrastructure</strong> project of the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd458919.aspx\">Reference  Implementation</a>. To check out an example of how it is being used you can  check the following files:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Shell.xaml</strong> file of the <strong>StockTraderRI </strong>project, which is where the behavior is set-up.</li>\r\n<li><strong>NewsController.cs</strong> file inside the  <strong>StockTraderRI.Modules.News</strong> project<strong>, </strong>which is  where a view is added to the region.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Please let me know if this helps.</p>\r\n<p>Damian Schenkelman <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
