This is why you  experienced this behavior.</p>\r\n<p>If you need guidance on how to perform a navigation request, you could take a look at  the following classes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>EmailNavigationItemView</li>\r\n<li>ContactsDetailNavigationItemView</li>\r\n<li>CalendarNavigationItemView</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For more information you could check the following documentation section in  the Prism4.chm:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Chapter 7: Navigation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Additionally, you could also check the following posts Karl Shifflett&rsquo;s  blog:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kashiffl/archive/2010/10/05/integrating-prism-v4-region-navigation-with-silverlight-frame-navigation.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0\">Integrating  Prism v4 Region Navigation with Silverlight Frame Navigation</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>On the other hand, if you consider that this scenario is really helpful, you  could create a work-item for this. So the product team will be notified and the  community can also vote this.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero&nbsp;<br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>",
