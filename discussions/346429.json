    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>As far as I know, it is usual to use only one of the two approaches when changing views within a region. Using two different approaches within the same region can cause some unexpected behaviors. For example, if you have a view which implements a <strong>OnNavigatedFrom </strong>method and you inject a view in the same region, the aforementioned method might not be invoked.</p>\r\n<p>However, based on my understanding, if you use view injection (or view discovery) only at start-up and then go further on with navigation, you should not find any serious problems.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
