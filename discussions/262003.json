I want when hd image is displayed in the browser to fits it's size without showing the scrolls , and to have the possibility of getting it's full\r\n size by clicking the magnifying glass with the plus , and to get back it's fit to window size when the minus is clicked , just as it is in Internet exlporer, if you can't imagine it try to open image in high resolution there to see what happens. I tried a\r\n lot of things - using the Scale method of the object to different sizes, changing the dock , setting the AutoScale propery of the container of the browser and a lot others , but none works ... will appreciate any help , thank you in advance !</p>\r\n",
