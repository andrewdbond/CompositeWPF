    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>Both <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>MEF</strong> have the same basic functionality for dependency injection, even they work differently.</p>\r\n<p>As Prism documentation shows <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921140(PandP.40).aspx\">in Chapter 3: Managing Dependencies Between Components</a></p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;<strong><em>Unity provides several capabilities that MEF does not</em></strong><em>:</em></p>\r\n<p><em>It resolves concrete types without registration.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>It resolves open generics.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>It uses interception to capture calls to objects and add additional functionality to the target object.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>MEF provides several capabilities that Unity does not</em></strong><em>:</em></p>\r\n<p><em>It discovers assemblies in a directory.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>It uses XAP file download and assembly discovery.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>It recomposes properties and collections as new types are discovered.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>It automatically exports derived types.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>It is deployed with the .NET Framework.</em>&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>As you can see, each container has specific capabilities. Therefore, if you are consider migrating from <strong>Unity</strong> to <strong>MEF</strong>, keep in mind the preceding capabilities and determine which of them fits your scenario better, along with the additional overhead of switching the DI mechanism you&rsquo;re using.</p>\r\n<p>Take into account that in Prism v4, the version of unity that is used is <strong>2.0.414.0</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Additionally, remember that <strong>Prism is extensible</strong>, allowing other containers to be used instead <strong>Unity</strong> or <strong>MEF</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this information useful.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Miguel Bronzovic<br /><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic\">http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
