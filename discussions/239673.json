That is to say, you could subscribe to an event in several components, all of which will recibe the event\r\n simultaneously. So, you could import the Event Aggregator in your view model and subscribe to the event, as you're doing in your shell.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, if you need to inject different views inside a region and switch between them based on the application's flow, you might find\r\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430861%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">Prism Navigation</a> useful to your scenario.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>\r\n",
