    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>Since the AllActiveRegion keeps all its views as active, its <strong>ActiveViews </strong>collection should not change when one of your views inside the accordion gets focus, so in this case it seems that it won't be useful to hook to that event.</p>\n<p>Therefore, (assuming you're referring to the <a href=\"http://wpf.codeplex.com/releases/view/40535\"> WPF Toolkit</a>'s accordion control), you could hook to its <strong>SelectionChanged </strong>event, which, based on my understanding, should be raised each time you switch the \"active\" element inside the accordion.</p>\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi&nbsp;<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
