Based on my understanding, the implementations details of how to load and reproduce the video should be handled by the control you use to reproduce the video while the prism library should only handle the UI composition (this is, adding the view containing the control to the region).</p>\r\n<p>For example, you could use this control or something similar:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.mediaelement.aspx\">MediaElement Class in MSDN</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" target=\"_blank\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
