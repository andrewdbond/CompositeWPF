Some of these transactions have child-transactions. The user can customize the view to show these child-transactions in the DataGrid too. But not on Top-Level.<br>\r\nI would like to o this with rowdetails. But not the way it is done at the moment. I would love to have a column where are little plus-buttons when a transaction has child-transactions. When the user clicks on a button the child-transaction / rowdetails should be visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have not found a way to achieve this yet, because I can not define a rowstyle with the rowdetailsproperties. I think they can only be set for the whole grid?<br>\r\nIs there a way to achieve something like this? Do I have to extend the grid somehow to be able to do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKind regards,<br>\r\nWoggly \r\n",
