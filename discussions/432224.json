    "Html": "Hi, <br />\n<br />\nAs far as I know the version of the <strong>Stocktrader RI</strong> provided since <strong>Prism v4</strong> was built using <strong>MEF</strong> as the container. But you may find that previous versions of this Reference Implementation, were built using <strong>Unity</strong> . For example you could check the one provided in the following source code:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/releases/view/46046\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prism 2.2</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nOn the other hand if you are interested in the main differences between both containers used by <strong>Prism</strong> I believe you could find the following chapter of the documentation useful:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921140%28v=pandp.40%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">3: Managing Dependencies Between Components</a> <br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nI hope you find this handy,<br />\n<br />\nAgustin Adami<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a><br />\n",
