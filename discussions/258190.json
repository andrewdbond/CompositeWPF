I still could not understnand why can i NOT do it the same way as in the Silverlight UIComposition quick start example ?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again!</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>When you bind to something inside a tab control's ItemContainerStyle, the \"Content.DataContext.ViewName\" indicates that you're binding to a property in the DataContext of the <em>content</em> of the tab, that is, the view added inside the tab item. That means that it binds to the ViewName property in the ViewModel of the view you're adding to the TabControl region.</p>\r\n<p>As for your second concern, you should take into account that there are differences in Silverlight and WPF's <strong>TabControl</strong>. For example, in WPF, the <strong>TabControl </strong>inherits from <strong>Selector</strong>, while in Silverlight it doesn't. That differences could account for the differences in the approachs that are taken to fulfill this scenario between Silverlight and WPF.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
