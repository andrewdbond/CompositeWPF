My team and I can't figure out how to link multiple plots. For example, if we have two chartplotters in the same grid area and we\r\n use the zoom or pan feature, then the plots should move/zoom in unison. Has anyone figured this out yet? If we can't do this with the D3 tools, then we'll have to revert back to the WPF extended toolkit. Please help.</p>\r\n",
