RibbonRegion or NavigationRegion =&gt; That will hold a module with buttons (one of them will be login button)</p>\r\n<p>2. MainRegion=&gt; this region will hold a module that when one of the button from navgation module is clicked</p>\r\n<p>3. Right and Left Region and Bottom Regions for other static content.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, the demo usecase will be that when user clicks on one of the buttons in the module which is in Ribbon region then it should load a module in main region. when the user clicks on the login button in ribbon region after successful login the navigation/ribbon\r\n region should change its view to new view that will contain some new buttons and when one of the buttons is clicked in this new module it should also load a module in the main region.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One choice would be using navigation application but working with prism and modularity will that work? still this is an open question for me but i tried to work with that but was unable to achive my goal.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>YOur help and ideas will highly be appreciated</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\nsirfmemon.</p>\r\n",

In simple words when i click on login button from the login view can i add views from another module into the navigation region? though LoginVIew belongs to seperate module and the other views i wanted to load\r\n on the login button click event belongs to another module.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>waiting for your prompt reply.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>sirfmemon</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi sirfmemon,</p>\r\n<p>The scenario you're describing is posible. You could use the Event Aggregator to publish an event when you click the Login Button, and then make your modules subscribe to that event, so that when the event is published they add their views (containing your\r\n buttons) to the pertinent navigation regions.</p>\r\n<p>You might find the following thread useful, as they deal with a similar scenario:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=212991\"><span>Login / Logout View Switching</span></a></p>\r\n<p><span>Take into account that:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span>Even though the user in that thread is using Unity as the Dependency Injection container, the scenario could also be achieved with MEF with only minor changes.</span>\r\n</li><li><span>The modules that contain the views are responsible for adding them to the regions. By publishing an event from your button, you're only communicating those modules that they have to add their views.</span>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>You can read more about this in the following articles from the Prism MSDN documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921098%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">Chapter 7: Composing the User Interface</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921122%28PandP.40%29.aspx\">Chapter 9: Communicating Between Loosely Coupled Components</a>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>\r\n",
