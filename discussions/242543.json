However the path was correct, the loading failed, because the dll couldn't be found. Then I started to look around and found that the module type loader cuts the first\r\n character of the path, when separating the path from the file prefix:&nbsp;string path = moduleInfo.Ref.Substring(RefFilePrefix.Length &#43; 1);</p>\r\n<p>The bug is located in the LoadModuleType method of the&nbsp;FileModuleTypeLoader class.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Csaba</p>\r\n",

One possible workaround for this, as explained in the work item, would be to write &quot;file:///YourModuleName.dll&quot;\r\n in the path for your module.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>\r\n",
