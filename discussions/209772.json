I am facing the issue that one of my modules has a WPF Web Browser control. Sometimes, when the web get stuck, the entire application get stuck too! Is there any way to run the modules in a different thread?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Many Thanks!</p>",

If the cause of the issue is not the specific control,  running the operations that are causing the delay in another  thread/asynchronously might bring some improvement. The <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/ee794896.aspx\">Reactive  Extensions for .NET (Rx)</a> might be useful for you in this case.</p>\r\n<p id=eaf6d990-2e0d-012d-2f6e-12313b069c21>Please let me know if this  helps.</p>\r\n<p id=eaf6ee40-2e0d-012d-2f6f-12313b069c21>Damian  Schenkelman    <br><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman</a></p>",
