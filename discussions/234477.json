Silverlight 4 includes commanding support for\r\n<strong>ButtonBase </strong>classes, but the <strong>TreeViewItem </strong>class does not derives from ButtonBase.</p>\r\n<p>That said, Prism provided commading support for <strong>ButtonBase </strong>classes in previous versions of Silverlight, so you could use this implementation as a reference. For more information you could take a look at the following links:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921126%28PandP.20%29.aspx\">Commands</a>, see the\r\n<em>Extending Command Support</em> section </li><li><a href=\"http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/184891/422118.aspx\">PRISM Commanding with UserControl</a>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>After implementing this, you could assign a <strong>DelegateCommand </strong>to the\r\n<strong>TreeviewItem </strong>like any other Binding.</p>\r\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\r\n<p>Fernando Antivero <br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fantivero</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
