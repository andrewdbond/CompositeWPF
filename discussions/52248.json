I try to summarize the approach what we took in our silverlight solution:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- We've implmenented a view and a viewmodel (username, password, ispersistent properties) and encapsulated this functionality into a module.<br>\r\n- We've defined 3 events, one of them is LoginRequested. This event is raised in 2 generic places: at app start early stage in shell initialization (because we've security trimmed UI) and raised from our WCF message inspector which is responsible to handle securityexceptions received from the server side.<br>\r\n- Your controller is subscribing to the LoginRequested event and present (in our case a dedicated popup region) the login view. and after a successful login your controller raising the LoginSuccessful event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not that complicated, I hope my write-up is clear, if not, then just ask :-)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm very curious about other's approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks,<br>\r\nAttila\r\n",
