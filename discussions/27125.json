It looks like it was introduced to support the RegionManagerService, but I would argue that RegionManagerService could accept an IPrismContainer in its ctor.<br /><br />Looking through the code, it looks like PrismContainerProvider holds the only non-circular reference to the IPrismContainer (and its underlying IUnityContainer/IWhateverContainer), since Bootstrapper classes are dismissed after they perform their duties. Will we continue to rely on the PrismContainerProvider to keep the container alive or will this responsibility lie elsewhere?<br />",

Using the PrismProviider allows the attached property to access the container. The cases where we woud use it are those where we cannot perform injection.<br /><br />Glenn<br />",
