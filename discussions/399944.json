As you may find the <strong>ModuleCatalog </strong>holds information about the modules that can be used by the application. This way in its\r\n<strong>Modules </strong>property you could find a collection of the <strong>ModuleInfo\r\n</strong>classes. This <strong>ModuleInfo </strong>classes will contain information of each module like the\r\n<strong>ModuleName </strong>and the <strong>ModuleState</strong>, which for example you could check to see if a module is\r\n<strong>&quot;</strong><em>NotStarted</em><strong>&quot; </strong>and react accordingly.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br>\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a>,</p>\r\n",
