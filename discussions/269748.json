    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>In this case the location of the child window depends on your preferences. For example, if you are going to use the child window in many views across different modules, it could make sense to store it in an infrastructure project. However if you don't want to have an strong reference to the child window, you could store it in a module, register it in the container, and resolve it when needed.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" target=\"_blank\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
