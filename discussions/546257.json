    "Html": "Hello,\r<br />\n<br />\nI implemented a Tab Region which works fine. The problem is that I have a separate menu region and the same menu command in the menu region should work differently depending on which tab in the TabControl is currently selected. I implemented IActiveAware in the view classes in the tab region. But all of the views' IsActive are set to true when the region.Activate() is called (I'm using view injection because I need to dynamically add tabs) and I cannot tell which tab is currently selected.\r<br />\n<br />\nHow do I know which tab is currently selected?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi Gabriel,\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for your response. I used region.ActiveViews.FirstOrDefault(). But it didn't work. The setter for the IsActive property was not called either when I clicked different tabs. However, I have finally found why those didn't work - I was using Telerik's RadTabControl, rather than the standard TabControl. I blindly assumed that the Telerik control simply inherits the standard one. But obviously it does not. When I replaced it with the standard one, everything worked.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you for your help, anyways.\r<br />\n<br />\nTetsu<br />\n",
