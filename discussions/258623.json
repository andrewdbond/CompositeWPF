My requirement is to be able to show some views in tabcontrol and others in modal windows. In my shell window, I could do only one thing at a time. All I want is\r\n that if some views could tell the shell to be added in the tab control region or shown as a model pop-up.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>Vijay</p>\r\n",

Therefore, you could to create your own implementation of <strong>DialogActivationBehavior</strong> for achieving your scenario, so that the window shown by the behavior is modal (for example, by calling the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.window.showdialog.aspx\">Window.ShowDialog</a> method in the <strong>WindowWrapper.Show</strong> method inside the <strong>WindowWrapper.Desktop.cs</strong> file.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this information useful.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Miguel Bronzovic<br /><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic\">http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
