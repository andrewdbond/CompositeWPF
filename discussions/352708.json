If so, you might have to ensure that all the projects reference the same <strong>Microsoft.Practices.*.dll</strong>, as the <strong>Prism4Demo </strong>project is not referencing the assemblies from the directory included in the sample, as it happens with the other projects. This can be easily achieved by removing and adding the  corresponding references.</p>\n<p>I hope you find this helpful,</p>\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>",
