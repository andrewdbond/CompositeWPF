I am wondering if anyone has had any experience upgrading mid project and had any insight. Normally I would not even consider it at this time, however I need to create a new region this iteration and was pretty excited about the RegionPopupBehaviors. I have not read all of the new documentation yet but from what I have so far it looks like there are a fair number of substantial changes. Anyone have any insight on this?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Brette</p>",
