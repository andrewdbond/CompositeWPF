Is it possible to configure prism to load the same module twice, but with different settings.</p>\r\n<p>For example: A map module, it has a map view that displays a map. The user could load the module the first time so he can see an entire county, and load the second time so he can be zoomed to a city. Both modules - views would be on the screen at the same\r\n time.</p>\r\n<p>So basically all the code would be identical ( because it is the same module ), but the user could have two sets of configuration data that tell the module what to display.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>In Prism, modules are not intended to be loaded more than once. However, after you have loaded a module, the view and all the components that you require to fulfill your use case (e.g. a viewmodel) can be instantiated more than once, so you can launch your components multiple times with different settings.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
