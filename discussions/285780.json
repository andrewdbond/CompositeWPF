Yes, as we use Telerik for graphic components, my modules has a reference to some heavy resources</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>=&gt; Thus, i would like to know if they are some way to decrease the load time ? Is there a way to pre-load all the resources ? As explained before, during startup of my application, i've tried to pre-load all the resources files (using Assembly.Load): now, in Visual Studio, i don't see the resources to be loaded when the view in my module is displayed (as i've pre-load them) but the view still take some times to be displayed the first time. Maybe there are something particular to pre-load the assemblies/resources ?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks !</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>PS: Unfortunately, i'm unable to send a repro-sample now (as it's a issue on our \"big\" application)</p>",
