But I don't want to set copyLocal=true, as dependency Module MyLibsModule has this dll, and I don't need duplicate.</div>\n<div>Any ideas?</div>\n<div>How come that MyModule fails with complain abt missed MyLibrary.dll if even constructor is not called in it.</div>\n<div>I expect sequence of events like this:</div>\n<div>1. MyLibsModule.xaml, MyModule.xaml&nbsp;downloaded from server,</div>\n<div>2. MyLibsModule constructor called.</div>\n<div>3. MyLibsModule imported.</div>\n<div>4. MyLibsModule initialized.</div>\n<div>Exception here....</div>\n<div>5. MyModule constructor called,</div>\n<div>\n<div>6. MyModule imported.</div>\n<div>7. MyModule initialized.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>If MyModule is loaded with Shell (InitializationMode=\"WhenAvailable\", which is equal to referencing MyLibrary.dll at compile time) then MyModule is loading no problem. I want all modules loaded on demand...-))</div>\n<div><br />I have demo project to show this....Initially I asked support from Telerik here:<a href=\"http://www.telerik.com/community/forums/silverlight/general-discussions/telerik-libs-prism-app.aspx\">http://www.telerik.com/community/forums/silverlight/general-discussions/telerik-libs-prism-app.aspx</a> , but obviously it is related to Prism.....</div>\n</div>",

    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>Before digging into your issue, it would be helpful to know that the recommended practice for having a third party class library shared across your modules is to have an infrastructure project referenced in all your modules. Modules are mostly meant to be discrete units of functionality that export views and/or services.</p>\r\n<p>As for your actual issue, the problem you&rsquo;re experiencing could be caused by the fact that your module isn&rsquo;t finding the dll which contains the classes you need to use. One possible way to solve it would be to reference the infrastructure project in your shell module with <strong>CopyLocal</strong> set to true; that way you could then reference that project from within other projects without the need to set <strong>CopyLocal</strong> to true, since the dll will have already been loaded in the shell&rsquo;s bin directory. That way you would avoid a duplicate reference.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this information useful.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Miguel Bronzovic<br /><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic\">http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Yes, this is what I ended up with..</p>\r\n<p>I see&nbsp;&nbsp;2 options either load infrastructure dlls into shell as static link, as u suggest or equally the same is to loas MyLibsModule in WhenAvailable mode.</p>\r\n<p>but I want to make shell as light as possible and as fast as possible, thats why I tried to move havy dlls into another module. Reason for this that shell may not need havy dll module and MyModule, so no point to load it.. u see what i mean?<br />But anyway it is still not clear for me, how come MyModule is failing if it even didn't started to load.</p>\r\n<p>Dependency modules loaded, as I see from step 4, so everything should be available for MyModule..</p>",
