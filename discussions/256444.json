I will have a look at the source code to see if I can easily extend the functionality.</p>\r\n<p>In particular, my scenario is that I have several sub-folders in the source project, and I would like to avoid the hassle of re-creating and filling these folders manually in the destination project. But maybe this is outside the scope of the Project Linker? Perhaps it is more of a task for a \"New project from existing\" template?&nbsp;</p>",
