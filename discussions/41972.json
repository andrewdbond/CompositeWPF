This might be because no configuration file was found for your application, or because no endpoint element matching this contract could be found in the client element.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:10pt;color:navy;font-family:arial\"></span></p>\r\nThis time I was ready for it and simply added my EmployeeServiceDAL to the Shell (main) project and all was well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  I'm not well-versed with Manifest (or the concept) so please bear with me but where exactly is the ModuleManifest.xaml file you were referring to?   With SCSF I was content with having a reference to each module so I could bypass the &quot;hard-to-maintain&quot; manifest file for Click-Once deployment but for our Silverlight app I think I'd rather learn how to manage it so we don't have to add references so our app will load/run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  How long is backlog?  Rough guestimate will do - I have to determine ROI for writing a utility we (the community) can use to &quot;easily&quot; develop our CompositeWPF/Prism apps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppreciate your time :)<br>\r\nBill<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
