Therefore, this <strong>Shared Service</strong> will be referenced in your application Modules so they can access the info stored in it. For more information about <strong>Shared Services</strong>, you can go to the following section of the Prism documentation:<br />\n<h1></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921122(v=pandp.40).aspx#sec7\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chapter 9: Communicating Between Loosely Coupled Components - Shared Services</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nI hope you find this useful, \r<br />\n<br />\nFederico Martinez \r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/fmartinez</a> <br />\n",
