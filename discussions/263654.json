As we know, a Service can be implemented in one Prism module and be consumed by another module with the help of a common service interface class library. But my current problem is, it's not possible to get&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Entity\r\n reference&quot; in common service class library.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For example, I created an interface IBookDataService in a common class library of &quot;MyApplication.Common&quot;, now I want to declare an method of</p>\r\n<pre><span> void</span> GetCategories(Action&lt;ObservableCollection&lt;<span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Category</strong></span>&gt;&gt; getCategoriesCallback);</pre>\r\n<pre><br></pre>\r\n<p>but it's not possible because the type &quot;<span style=\"color:#ff0000\">Category</span>&quot; in unknown in current common class library, only Prism modules have &quot;RIA Link&quot; to RIA Services and get access to server side business entities by local proxy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre><span style=\"color:blue\">public</span> <span style=\"color:blue\">interface</span> IBookdataService\r\n{\r\n     <span style=\"color:green\">//Category is unknown, because MyApplication.Common class library has no RIAService LINK to the web project.</span>\r\n     <span style=\"color:blue\">void</span> GetCategories(Action&lt;ObservableCollection&lt;Category&gt;&gt; getCategoriesCallback);\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Is there some way to solve my service problem? I really need the services to&nbsp;separate&nbsp;concerns of ViewModel in Prism modules. Thanks for your help.</p>\r\n",
