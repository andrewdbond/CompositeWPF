The way to determine that is to provide a subscription token, which is an identifier of the subscription. The token is returned when you call the <strong>Subscribe </strong>method of a <strong>CompositePresentationEvent</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>You can find more information about this in the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921122%28PandP.40%29.aspx#sec10\">CompositePresentationEvent section</a> of the Communication Chapter in the Prism MSDN documentation.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi<br /> <a href=\"http://prismtk.codeplex.com/\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
