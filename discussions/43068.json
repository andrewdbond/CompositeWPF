The module is referencing another assembly which is a client proxy that is consuming a WCF service. The problem is that the moduleÂ cannot find the app.config file. I tried to locate the file is the shell project, the module project and the proxy project but neither worked... <br>\r\nWhy is the app.config not found? How do I get the proxy assembly to load the WCF configuration section from the app.config in the same project?<br>\r\nThank you,<br>\r\nKen<br>\r\n",
