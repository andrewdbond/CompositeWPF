There's probably no limitation that would halt you from using <strong>RelayCommands</strong> in Prism, but there is no intentional integration between them an the Prism mechanisms for modularity, UI composition, and so forth.</p>\n<p>Also, for matters specifically related to the <strong>RelayCommand</strong> functionality, you might find better support about it in the <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en/wpf/threads/\">WPF forums</a>.</p>\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
