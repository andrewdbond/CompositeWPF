The application appears to function, although I have not performed a full test. Just wanted to let others know about the problem in case they have the same experience. Perhaps this element should be removed altogether. There is only one project, so the value of having a GlobalAssemblyInfo reference eludes me. Is the assumption that I will include this project within each WPF solution I want to deploy using ClickOnce??? If so, is that documented anywhere (everything I've found just says to make sure you compile it).</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>~Justin</p>",
