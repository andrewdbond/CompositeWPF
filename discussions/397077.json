So far, the only sample I have seen that applies drag and drop functionality to move views between different regions can be found in the following blog post:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/2009/06/05/how-to-drag-and-drop-wpf-views-between-regions-in-prism-v2/\">How to: Drag and Drop WPF Views between Regions in Prism-v2</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Perhaps, you could find it useful, as a starting on how to tackle this kind of scenarios.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, you could also check the following related resources:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/155648/390358.aspx\">Drag and Drop with MVVM</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/csharpgeneral/thread/47140382-92b7-484e-8ec7-c57bbd997296\">MVVM with Drag &amp; Drop</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/86530/200711.aspx#200711\">Drag &amp; Drop and modifying Width via mouse while using MVVM - Databinding</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>",
