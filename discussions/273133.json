I am using Prism and Unity;</p>\r\n<p>The first time the application starts, I can create a booking no problem. I then close that view and try create another.</p>\r\n<p>Now when I created the first booking, I create a new Booking. It gets and ID of 0; When I try create another booking</p>\r\n<p>it tells me that it cannot attach the entity booking ID 0 because it is attached to another entityset.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>I have tried everything I can think off. It seems that because the view does not get destroyed the domain context remains</p>\r\n<p>active. Even when exiting the first booking I have asked it to detach the booking.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Any help will be great.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Louis</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",
