General infrastructure has multiple modules and one of them is used as master application which downloads other modules. In addition to modularization, redusing xap size is also used with and\r\n creation of zip file are successfully done.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The problem is if master module does not have reference to a zipped assembly, other modules cannot be loaded because their different reference assemblies(which are also zipped successfully by related module) are not downloaded. Is there any fix or workaround\r\n that can force these assemblies to be loaded if they are not downloaded yet ?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n",
