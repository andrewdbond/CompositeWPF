The UserControl has a PropertyGrid which loads on the shell but after a considerable amount of time and it overflows outside the bounds of the parent (DockPanel, StackPanel, Grid) I try to put it in. This happens if I add the PropertyGrid in Xaml but if I add the grid in code nothing shows up, the control is just blank.<br> <br> &nbsp;Has anyone tried out this scenario at all, I would appreciate any help and guidance as I have been sdtruggling for the past two days with this..<br> <br> Thanks in advance</p>",
