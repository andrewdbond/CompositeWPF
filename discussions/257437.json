In order to better understand&nbsp;I've built a simple app with two modules, one region.&nbsp;In both of the modules Initialize methods\r\n I register the respective view with the region.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What is confusing me is both views seem to be active. How would I switch back and forth between the two (after they have both been registered)?</p>\r\n<p>I've implemented&nbsp;IConfirmNavigationRequest and can walk through the calls to the region after I call&nbsp;RequestNavigate, but I guess I'm not sure what to do to get rid of the old region, (and surprised that I would have to do anything at all).</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "<p>What are you using as your region container? ItemsControl/ContentControl or Grid? Based on your description above looks like you have the itemscontrol as your region host. ItemsControl has a <strong>AllActiveRegion</strong> which is why all views that load into the region remain active. ContentControl has a <strong>SingleActiveRegion</strong>, which probably what you need, which only keeps one view active at a time.</p>\r\n<p>Also read up on the RegionMemberLifetime attribute. That will tell then region how to deal with the view.</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Ganesh</p>",
