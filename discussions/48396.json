I mean how many modules can be loaded into the memory at a time with a given limit on RAM and how many events can have in the application. How many views with minimum controls can have in a Module. Looking for a basic benchmark for enterprise application. Because we are going to build a very large product in WPF using the Prism pattern. The application might have more than 100 of modules and many views, based on the benchmark and guidelines we want to limit the number of modules and views. Also Unity uses reflection foe DI so i am worried about the performance when a modules are loaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
