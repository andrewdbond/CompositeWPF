So where is the best place to get the binaries?</p>\r\n<p>2. &nbsp;When browsing the source I see a V1, V2 and V3 folder. Which version is most mature and compatible with Silverlight 3?</p>\r\n<p>3. &nbsp;Should I just&nbsp;download the binaries from the Vx branch or should I download the source and compile locally?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\r\n<p>Tarek</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
