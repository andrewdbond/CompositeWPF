    "Html": "Having worked with the Smart Client Software Factory (SCSF)&nbsp;and Web Client Software factory (WCSF) I also was looking for the guidance recipes to create my Project, Business/Infrastructure modules, views, etc (code generator for those not familiar with recipes) .&nbsp; What I found was the &quot;Development Activities&quot; section in the Documentation that provided relatively simple steps (few lines of code) to get a CompositeWPF application up and running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI havn't heard anything about Guidance Recipes for the CompositeWPF, I just assumed that because of the two different patterns (Supervising Controller MVP and Presentation Model) as well as the fact that within XAML sometimes you don't even need code, e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.global-webnet.net/flash/ClickMe.htm\">RSS feed viewer</a> that it wasn't practical....&nbsp; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you're interested... I'm taking the MPV route; I've created an infrastructure taking the best of what I learned SCSF as well as features I really like about WCSF, i.e., a default Controller in addition to the Presenter.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my <a href=\"http://www.CodePlex.com/SDMS\">http://www.CodePlex.com/SDMS</a> project I have a MainShell where all one has to do is set a reference to their specific module / application and its work is done.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the current Change Set (source code) it has a reference to the RSSFeed module as well as SDMSMain application - SDMSMain&nbsp;contains the main layout which is loaded in the MainShell;&nbsp; RSSFeed is a &quot;On-Demand&quot; module that isn't loaded until Tools | Options is selected as shown in the above RSS feed viewer link.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll find I'm moving as much code as possible into the base classes, e.g., PresenterBase so that I can create new modules / views with minimal coding.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps when the infrastructure is done I'll create a guidance package to support it....<br>\r\n",

They constantly pushed for the “Simple first” approach while designing the API, in order to avoid the need for tooling in the first place.</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0pt\"><span><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0pt\"><span><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">Perhaps you may find useful the Visual Studio templates available in the source code of the </span><a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/CompositeWPFContrib\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">CompositeWPFContrib</span></a><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\"> project:</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0pt 0.5in\"><span style=\"font-family:Symbol\"><span>·<span style=\"font:7pt 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">Download the </span><a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/CompositeWPFContrib/SourceControl/DownloadSourceCode.aspx?changeSetId=14588\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">last change set</span></a><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\"> of the <b>CompositeWPFContrib</b> source code.</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0pt 0.5in\"><span style=\"font-family:Symbol\"><span>·<span style=\"font:7pt 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span><a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/CompositeWPFContrib/Wiki/View.aspx?title=VisualStudioTemplates\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">Visual Studio Templates</span></a></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0pt\"><span><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0pt\"><span><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">Please, let me know if it helps.</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0pt\"><span style=\"color:#1f497d\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin:0in 0in 0pt\"><span><span style=\"font-family:Calibri\">Mariano Converti</span></span></p>\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:'Calibri','sans-serif'\"><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/mconverti\">http://blogs.southworks.net/mconverti</a></span></span></span>\r\n",
