    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>We debugged your application and found that the <strong>AdminHomeView </strong>view is registered correctly in the <strong>MainContentRegion</strong>.</p>\n<p>On the other hand we found that your <strong>MainContentRegion </strong>is defined in a <strong>Grid </strong>inside a<strong> BusyIndicator</strong>, which uses the <strong> NavigationGridStyle </strong>style. The problem seems to be in this particular style which sets the <strong>Height </strong>property with a predefined value and the <strong>MainContentRegion </strong>is not being shown as the <strong>Grid </strong>is too small.</p>\n<p>To solve this you could try not setting the value of this property in the aforementioned style.</p>\n<p>Also you could try defining your <strong>MainContentRegion </strong>outside the <strong>BusyIndicator</strong>.</p>\n<p>I hope you find this helpful,</p>\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a>ï»¿</p>",
