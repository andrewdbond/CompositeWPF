Just today I got v2 drop #7 and I am going nuts trying to find out why the quickstarts don't build! Since there isn't anybody here complaining, I am certain the problem is my environment, and I would like your help to figure out what I can do to fix it. I get the\r\nfollowing errors:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nError&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The &quot;AssignCulture2&quot; task was not found. Check the\r\nfollowing: 1.) The name of the task in the project file is the same as\r\nthe name of the task class. 2.) The task class is &quot;public&quot; and\r\nimplements the Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask interface. 3.) The task\r\nis correctly declared with &lt;UsingTask&gt; in the project file, or in\r\nthe *.tasks files located in the\r\n&quot;C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v3.5&quot; directory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\r\n<strong>(Composite.Silverlight, Composite.UnityExtensions.Silverlight, Composite.Presentation.Silverlight)<br>\r\n</strong><br>\r\nError&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;53&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The &quot;CompileXaml&quot; task was not given a value for the required parameter &quot;TargetFrameworkDirectory&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\r\n<strong>(Composite.Presentation.Silverlight.Tests, Commanding.Silverlight, Commanding.Modules.Order.Silverlight)<br>\r\n</strong><br>\r\nEdit: Indeed, 1 hour after I posted my question I uninstalled/reinstalled SL tools, and everything works ok. Maybe this newbie post will help somebody else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
