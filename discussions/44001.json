I just want to have the dynamic rows and columns (no need to have AcceptChanges or Rollback or etc).. but that class should be able to bind with DataGrid. My requirement is that I want to show the Datagrid with dynamic columns. Instead of adding the DataGridColumn from Code-behind, I'm looking for a way that we can bind from View Model. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have tested in WPF and I can use DataTable to fullfill that purpose but I need to do the same thing for Silverlight since we are sharing the ViewModel class in both WPF and Silverlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",

If you want to extend it just add the fields you need as properties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can always resort to string[] to represent rows.Â  Id be using arrays or collections of classes. \r\n",
