    "Html": "Hi All,\r<br />\n<br />\nCurrently I am using Prism 4.1 as my component application development platform. I am using WPFMDI(<a href=\"http://wpfmdi.codeplex.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wpfmdi.codeplex.com/</a>) so that i can hold each view of module as a child of MdiContainer, in order to make this, i wrote below custom region adaptor:\r<br />\n<br />\nprotected override void Adapt(IRegion region, MdiContainer regionTarget)<br />\n<pre><code>    {\n        region.Views.CollectionChanged += (sender, e) =&gt;\n        {\n            switch (e.Action)\n            {\n                case NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Add:\n                    foreach (FrameworkElement element in e.NewItems)\n                    {\n                        IView view = element as IView;\n                        if (null != view)\n                        {\n                            BaseViewModel viewModel = view.GetViewModel();\n                            if (null != viewModel)\n                            {\n                                MdiChild mdiChild = new MdiChild();\n                                if (null != viewModel.ViewObject)\n                                {\n                                    mdiChild.Title = viewModel.ViewObject.Title;\n                                    mdiChild.Height = viewModel.ViewObject.Height;\n                                    mdiChild.Width = viewModel.ViewObject.Width;\n                                }\n                                mdiChild.Content = element;\n                                regionTarget.Children.Add(mdiChild);\n                                IRegionManagerService regionManagerService = ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance&lt;IRegionManagerService&gt;();\n                                regionManagerService.AddView(viewModel.ViewObject);\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                    break;\n\n                case NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Remove:\n                    foreach (UIElement elementLoopVariable in e.OldItems)\n                    {\n                        var element = elementLoopVariable;\n\n                        //if (regionTarget.Items.Contains(element))\n                        //{\n                        //    regionTarget.Items.Remove(element);\n                        //}\n                    }\n                    break;\n            }\n        };\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\nHowever, I need to implement below features:\r<br />\n<br />\nwhen a view is requested via RequestNavigate, if it's not opened yet(I check this via Uri with query parameter), the view is shown as a child of mdicontaner.\r<br />\nif it's opened already, I need to activate it as a child of mdicontaner.\r<br />\n<br />\nCould anyone give me some idea which region i should use, i am currently using MdiContainer as prism container, but i don't think it's good, there should be some better solution...<br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi Peter,\r<br />\n<br />\nI believe I am not fully understanding you question.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe navigation functionality you are describing of &quot;activating an existing view based on the navigation parameters or injecting a new one if it does not exist&quot; is already supported by <strong>Prism</strong>'s navigation API as out of the box. You can find a description of this in the following section of the documentation:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg430861%28v=pandp.40%29.aspx#sec15\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chapter 8 - Navigation - The Region Navigation Sequence</a><br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nHence, you would only need to adapt the <strong>MdiContainer</strong> control to a region (like with your region adapter) and sync the <strong>Views</strong> and <strong>ActiveViews</strong> collections of the region with the visual state of the corresponding controls (for example, the non active views could be shown as minimized <strong>MdiChild</strong> and the active ones as opened). Which type of region are you using in your region adapter? ( <strong>Region</strong>, <strong>SingleActiveRegion</strong>, <strong>AllActiveRegion</strong>, etc)\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nDamian Cherubini\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a><br />\n",
