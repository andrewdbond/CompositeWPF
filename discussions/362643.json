But now I'm stuck trying to navigate to region inside simple WPF Popup control. As far as I understood RegionManager.Regions isn't populating\r\n with my region created inside Popup. I set region with:</p>\r\n<p>RegionManager.SetRegionName(content, Common.RegionNames.PopupFilter);</p>\r\n<p>Probably somewhere inside Prism engine, it tries to find parent Window object and fails because Popup doesn't belong to any window<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease advice</p>\r\n",

    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>Based on my understanding if your are simple showing a new popup window, and defining regions within it. You will have to manually set the\r\n<strong>RegionManager </strong>for this new window. For example like this:</p>\r\n<div style=\"color:black; background-color:white\">\r\n<pre>RegionManager.SetRegionManager(popupWindow, <span style=\"color:blue\">this</span>.Container.Resolve&lt;IRegionManager&gt;());\nRegionManager.UpdateRegions();\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>An example of this can also be seen in the following blog post and related work item:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dschenkelman/2010/01/26/creating-a-multi-shell-application-in-prism-v2/\">Creating a multi-shell application in Prism-v2</a>\r\n</li><li><a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/workitem/3216\">Applications may have multiple shell windows</a>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Also, in my case I have used the <strong>WindowDialogActivationBehavior </strong>\r\nincluded with the <strong>Stock Trader RI</strong>, which allows you to define a region that, when a view is added to it, will be shown in a new window/popup. With this approach you should also be able to see regions defined inside your popups.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on this topic, you could take a look at the following code files (in the\r\n<strong>WPF </strong>version of the RI):</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>StockTraderRI_Desktop\\StockTraderRI.Infrastructure\\Behaviors\\RegionPopupBehavior.cs</em>\r\n</li><li><em>StockTraderRI_Desktop\\StockTraderRI.Infrastructure\\Behaviors\\WindowsDialogActivationBehavior.cs</em>\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>I hope you find this handy,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br>\r\nhttp://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>\r\n",
