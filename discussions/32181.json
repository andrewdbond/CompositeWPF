    "Html": "Hi Lawndart6,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no way you can load two assemblies with the same name and type name. You could modify the framework to support checking the public key, but I wouldn't advise you to do so.<br>\r\nThe reason why you shouldn't do this is because you can't tell the modules physically apart from each other. This may cause problems for others who have to work with the module. Also you can't place them in the same directory because the filename is most likely also the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy advice is to change the naming of the assemblies or merge the contents if the assemblies provide the same functionality.<br>\r\n",
