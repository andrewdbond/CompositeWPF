    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>We checked Prism&rsquo;s code and found that this is a bug in the Prism Library. The problem you are describing happens because the Region&rsquo;s region context is being removed from the region itself after a view is removed in it, in response of the <strong>KeepAlive</strong> property set to false and the view being deactivated.</p>\r\n<p>This happens because, in the <strong>BindRegionContextToDependencyObjectBehavior</strong>, when a view is removed from a region, the <strong>DetachNotifyChangeEvent</strong> method is should be called before setting the view&rsquo;s RegionContext attached property to null, but it&rsquo;s called after that. Therefore, when setting the view&rsquo;s RegionContext to null (since it has been removed from the region), the Region Context in the region itself is also set to null, thus causing this unexpected behavior.</p>\r\n<p>We have created a <a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/discussions/(http:/compositewpf.codeplex.com/workitem/8225\">work item</a> in the Issue Tracker to notify the team about this behavior.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Miguel Bronzovic<br /><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic\">http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
