    "Html": "Hi,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks a lot for your help. In my test app, I have modules with views and viewmodels which should be hosted in the shell, a core lib containg common stuff and the start project. I need to have at least three regions in my app, a toolbar region and a navigator\r\n region which are hosting &quot;fixed&quot; modules after start up, but they could be replaced by another toolbar or navigator module later. Further I have a main region which should host views from different, independent modules (as plugin) and only at runtime the view\r\n to load is known. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my solution on, but I'm still at the beginning of implementing those scenarios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegards,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon: DCherubini [email removed]<br>\r\nGesendet: Do 09.08.2012 20:17<br>\r\nAn: Anne Schmid<br>\r\nBetreff: Re: Loading Modules by config file with MEF bootstrapper and desktop application [CompositeWPF:390892]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom: DCherubini<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHi,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased on my understanding, if the modules are being load and initialized, it means that your application is able to locate your modules through your configuration catalog correctly.
