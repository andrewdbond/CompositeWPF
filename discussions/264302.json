Therefore, you could navigate to a popup region, which should result in a view being shown inside a child window.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Prism does not provide guidance on authentication scenarios. However, there should be no impediment for you to use Enterprise Library, or any other library that supports authentication.</p>\r\n<p>Abstracting from the actual mechanism you choose to use to implement authentication, once you decide whether your user is authenticated or not, you could use the Event Aggregator to publish an event that indicates your modules to load their components, based on the fact that your user is authenticated or not. You could also perform a navigation request to different views, based on the same fact.</p>\r\n<p>You might find the following threads useful, where the subject of authentication is treated:<a id=\"ThreadTitleLink\" class=\"ThreadLink\" href=\"78350\"></a></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a id=\"ThreadTitleLink\" class=\"ThreadLink\" href=\"78350\">Prism - Silverlight WCF RIA Services - Authentication</a></li>\r\n<li><a id=\"ThreadTitleLink\" class=\"ThreadLink\" href=\"262772\">Custom Authentication &amp; RIA service</a></li>\r\n<li><a id=\"ThreadTitleLink\" class=\"ThreadLink\" href=\"58292\">Show login modal form before</a></li>\r\n<li><a id=\"ThreadTitleLink\" class=\"ThreadLink\" href=\"211908\">Prism : Add a window in a region</a></li>\r\n<li><a id=\"ThreadTitleLink\" class=\"ThreadLink\" href=\"83910\">Login Page with Prism(CAG)</a></li>\r\n<li><a id=\"ThreadTitleLink\" class=\"ThreadLink\" href=\"84031\">Prism + login page</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Guido Leandro Maliandi <br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi\">http://blogs.southworks.net/gmaliandi</a></p>",
