    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>As far as I know, so far <strong>Prism </strong>does not contain an specific sample with this scenario. On the other hand, based on my understanding you should be able to bind your <strong>ComboBox </strong>to a view model that represents a collection or to a property that returns a collection via the <strong>ItemSource </strong>property, similarly when working with <strong>Itemscontrols </strong>or <strong>ListBox </strong>controls.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on how to achieve data binding in your controls and the different approaches on how to wire your <strong>View Model </strong>to your views I recommend you to check the following chapters of the <strong>Prism </strong>documentation:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405484(v=pandp.40).aspx\">5: Implementing the MVVM Pattern</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg405494(v=pandp.40).aspx\">6: Advanced MVVM Scenarios</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I hope you find this helpful,</p>\r\n<p>Agustin Adami<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami\"><br /> http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami</a></p>",
