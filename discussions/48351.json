For the visibility you should try to use a Model variable binding with a ValueConverter which looks up the ItemsControl's DataContext for you. But since DataContext is assigned downwards the VisualTree afaik, your button should also has access to the same data within it's DataContext property, but I can't tell this from your snippet above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhth,<br>\r\nAttila\r\n",

Couldn't find a sample in the StockTrader. Just samples where they use DataBinding...<br>\r\nAnd the enabling and disabling is not working like in WPF... Do I have to bind this too? And how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit: My Error Sorry. It is not working with Databinding.. Same Problem as described below. Need to find the overlaying DataContext somehow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe visibility is more complex. Thought it would work the same way. But as you say, there is no RelativeSource... The Problem is, that the Button is in a DataTemplate for a rowdetails of a Datagrid. The ViewModel is assigned to the whole Datagrid and there is the visibility and everything else set. But the Buttons are shown when one Row is selected and because of that for the button not the whole set (ViewModel) is the datacontext but only one Item in the set. I get BindingErrors saying that SaveVisibility is not defined on that item. I need a way to go up like in WPF.... \r\n",

Let’s hope for it in SL3 :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to workaround it, you have some options.<br>\r\nIf the command you are trying to bind to is a global command (and not an instance command hanging from your ViewModel), and I guess it is your case because you were first using the x:Static markup, then the solution is pretty easy.<br>\r\nYou need to create a command proxy class that expose the commands.<br>\r\nThen add this class to the Resources (either in App.xaml or in your UserControl for the view)<br>\r\nBind to the command using StaticResource in the Source property</p>\r\n<p>public class KontoCommandsProxy<br>\r\n{<br>\r\n  public ICommand SaveKontenCommand { get { ... } }<br>\r\n}</p>\r\n<p>&lt;UserControl ... &gt;<br>\r\n&lt;UserControl.Resources&gt;<br>\r\n  &lt;presenters:KontoCommandsProxy x:Key=&quot;KontoCommandsProxy&quot; /&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;/UserControl.Resources&gt;<br>\r\n  ...<br>\r\n  &lt;DataGrid&gt;<br>\r\n    ...<br>\r\n    &lt;Button Click.Command=&quot;{Binding SaveKontenCommand, Source={StaticResource KontoCommandsProxy}}&quot; ... /&gt;<br>\r\n  &lt;/DataGrid&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;/UserControl&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn case this is an instance command and not a global one, you can check out the PositionSummaryView in the StockTrader RI, which handles this scenario, although the workaround is a little more complex than this one, due to the lack of DynamicResource in SL again.</p>\r\n<p>I hope this helps,<br>\r\nJulian Dominguez<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/jdominguez\">http://blogs.southworks.net/jdominguez</a> </p>\r\n",

Perhaps I just have to wait until SL3... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit: I got it working, in fact it is working nearly perfect.. But the enabled Status is not updated correctly... When I edit something in a details template nothing happens to my Buttons. When I select another Row there the Buttons are enabled and dsabled as they should. Do I have to Refresh the pasge after each edit?? In the WPF implementation this works fine and the debugging shows that everything is the right way.\r\n",
