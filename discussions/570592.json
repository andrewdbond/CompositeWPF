This is a project targeting .NET 4.5.1.<br />\n<br />\nAs soon as I make a ViewModel inherit BindableBase, the compiler throws this error:<br />\n<pre><code>Reference required to assembly 'System.ObjectModel, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' containing the implemented interface 'System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged'.

That's the reason I created this new post.<br />\n",

    "Html": "OK this is crazy. The project with the above problem was originally targeting .NET 4.0. I changed it's properties to target 4.5.1, and added prism. That caused the above issue.\r<br />\n<br />\nI then decided to try and create a new project (directly targeting 4.5.1) and added it to the same solution. Then copied all the files from the original project to the new project, set the same references on the new project as the original project. And the compiler is now happy!\r<br />\n<br />\nSo, problem solved, although I don't know what was wrong.<br />\n",
