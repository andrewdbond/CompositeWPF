    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nBased on my understanding a region based on a <strong>ContentControl</strong> only maintains one active view at the same time. Therefore, during navigation any previous views in the region will be deactivated. If you want to maintain a deactivated view alive inside the region, you can make it implement the <strong>IRegionMemberLifetime</strong> interface in its view model and return <strong><em>true</em></strong> in its <strong>KeepAlive</strong> property. If you wish to reuse an existing view that is being kept alive in the region, you can make it implement the <strong>INavigationAware</strong> interface. If its <strong>IsNavigationTarget</strong> method returns <strong><em>true</em></strong>, the region will navigate to the existing view. If it returns <strong><em>false</em></strong>, a new view will be used instead.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso, in order for this to work correctly you need to register the views in the container using the exact name of the view type. For example:<br />\n<div style=\"color:Black;background-color:White;\"><pre>\r\nappContainer.RegisterType&lt;<span style=\"color:Blue;\">object</span>, AuthenticatedUser&gt;(<span style=\"color:#A31515;\">&quot;AuthenticatedUser&quot;</span>);\r\n</pre></div>Hope this helps,\r<br />\n<br />\nDamian Cherubini\r<br />\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a><br />\n",
