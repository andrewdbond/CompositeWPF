I updated my project to .Net Framework 4.5.1 and NuGet Manager updated the other libraries. In this case the new version of Unity will be used (the old one was 2.1.505.2). After the update of Unity Container,  the WCF service reference in my project can’t be updated (generated). The WCF generator expect the old version of unity for prism.\r<br />\nI’d like to use the new version of Unity, because my Test project use an AutoMock Library, which need this version of unity…\r<br />\n<br />\nBest regards\r<br />\nMarian<br />\n",
