I need to access datatemplates defined within xaml (of course).</p>\r\n<p>Problem: the templates are defined within a views xaml. Application.Current.FindResource(...) cannot find the template. How to lead .FindResource(...) to the appropriate template?</p>\r\n<p><br>Another approach via setting the templates within xaml to public properties will not be an option. It leads actually to unresolvable circular references with Resource-Section. Thats why I need to find the templates within .SelectTemplate(...).</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for any hint.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>schue</p>",
