As name indicated, I host a menu bar in menu bar region; and main region is the main area my application works.</p>\r\n<p>I created several modules to host in main region as well. Let's say the first module is customer search module/view, there are some text boxes to let user enter search conditions, and there is a button to load list of customers. If user wants to see details of selected customer in the list, I would like to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>unload current module/view from main region;</li>\r\n<li>load a different module/view (customer detail module/view) to main region;</li>\r\n<li>pass selected customer object from customer list module/view to customer detail module/view;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The problem is that module is not aware of other modules, ï»¿I can use event aggregator to publish events, but how can I broadcast customer object as parameter while event is publish? And how can I inform shell to load proper module (customer detail module/view) from customer list module/view?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>\r\n<p>Hardy</p>",
