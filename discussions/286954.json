You can use all of prism, or just pieces.<br /><br />My company found prism towards the end of a project and I used some of their commanding stuff in a control we used. On learning prism this past month I can say their is a learning curve but after understanding MEF and the basics of composite applications it really is a great way to develop an application. I think small or large. Though the benefits are probably clearer on a large multi developer application.</p>",
