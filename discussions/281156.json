    "Html": "<p>Hi Sakthi,</p>\r\n<p>When a type/instance is registered with a <strong>contract name</strong> in the container, that name is going to be used by the navigation framework. However, based on my understanding, the <strong>contract name</strong> is different from the <strong>view name</strong> and it cannot be used to get a specific view from a region.</p>\r\n<p>To get a specific view from a region using the contract name, you might find the following blog post useful:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/aadami/2011/10/14/matching-contract-names-and-view-names-in-prism-region-navigation/\">Matching contract names and view names in Prism region navigation</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once you have the view that must be focused, you might be able to focus it like any other element.</p>\r\n<p>You might find better support about how to focus a specific element in the following forums:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/wpf/threads/\">Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) Forums</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://forums.silverlight.net/\">Silverlight Forums</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Also, it might be possible that depending of the type of <strong>Region </strong>where the view is hosted, you might find useful to activate the view using the Activate method of the region instead of setting the application focus manually.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this useful,</p>\r\n<p>Damian Cherubini<br /> <a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini\" target=\"_blank\">http://blogs.southworks.net/dcherubini</a></p>",
