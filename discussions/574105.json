In the module's initializer I add 4 views to the region using RegionManager.RegisterViewWithRegion.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf I put a ViewSortHint on each of the 4 Views, sorting in the TabControl is as expected. If I omit the ViewSortHint for one view, this view is ordered ahead of the views having a ViewSortHint. This seems odd and to be in contradiction with the text at the bottom of page 143 of the guide where it reads &quot;Views that have the sort hint attribute are ordered ahead of those without.&quot;.\r<br />\n<br />\nAm I doing a mistake or is there an error in this simple aspect of the Prism library?<br />\n",
