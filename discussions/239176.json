The error you're experiencing might be because you're\r\n adding some references to compiled assemblies, and some to the projects.</p>\r\n<p>In order to avoid these errors, you could try removing all the references in your target solution, and then adding the references to the projects from the Prism Library (not the compiled DLLs). Conversely, you could add all the compiled DLLs and not the\r\n projects, which should work as well.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this information useful.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Miguel Bronzovic<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic\">http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Note that after you have removed the assemblies,\r\n you should clean your solution, and only then you should add the references to the projects.</p>\r\n<p id=\"x_6c19dcf0-f0d7-012d-bce7-123139181d06\">An example of your solution structure would be like this (assuming that you're using all of the Prism Library's functionalities):</p>\r\n<p id=\"x_6c1a2410-f0d7-012d-bced-123139181d06\" style=\"padding-left:30px\"><strong><em>---</em></strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"x_6c1a2410-f0d7-012d-bced-123139181d06\" style=\"padding-left:30px\">&Oslash;\r\n<strong><em>Prism.Desktop </em></strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"x_6c1a3140-f0d7-012d-bcee-123139181d06\" style=\"padding-left:30px\">&Oslash;\r\n<strong><em>Prism.MefExtensions.Desktop or Prism.UnityExtensions.Desktop</em></strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"x_6c1a40c0-f0d7-012d-bcef-123139181d06\" style=\"padding-left:30px\">&Oslash;\r\n<strong><em>Prism.Interactivity</em></strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"x_6c1a40c0-f0d7-012d-bcef-123139181d06\" style=\"padding-left:30px\"><strong><em>---</em></strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"x_6c1a5080-f0d7-012d-bcf0-123139181d06\" style=\"padding-left:30px\">&Oslash;\r\n<strong><em>ModuleA --&gt; Reference to the projects from above</em></strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"x_6c1a5080-f0d7-012d-bcf0-123139181d06\" style=\"padding-left:30px\">&Oslash;\r\n<strong><em>ModuleB --&gt; Reference to the projects from above</em></strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"x_6c1a5080-f0d7-012d-bcf0-123139181d06\" style=\"padding-left:30px\">&Oslash;<em><strong> (...)&nbsp;</strong></em><strong><em> --&gt; Reference to the projects from above</em></strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"x_6c1a6290-f0d7-012d-bcf1-123139181d06\" style=\"padding-left:30px\">&Oslash;\r\n<strong><em>ShellProject </em><em>--&gt; Reference to the projects from above</em></strong></p>\r\n<p id=\"x_6c1a9d00-f0d7-012d-bcf4-123139181d06\">I hope you find this handy to resolve your scenario.</p>\r\n<p id=\"x_6c1ab300-f0d7-012d-bcf5-123139181d06\">Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Miguel Bronzovic<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic\">http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
