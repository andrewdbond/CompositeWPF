You should take into account, however, that Prism is container agnostic, so you could try using other Dependency Injection containers, some\r\n of which may already have a WP7 version. You can read more about the container agnostic design of prism in this thread:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=228924\"><span>MEF or Unity for Prism v4 &quot;Dependency Injection&quot;?</span></a></p>\r\n<p>Thank you again for your contribution.
