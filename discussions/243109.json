    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi Antonio,</p>\r\n<p>One possible way to achieve this is to create a custom control that inherits from (for example) a content control or an items control, but which implements logic for animating the view switching inside it. That control would act as the region in which you\r\n would navigate. Therefore, the animation logic would be decoupled from the navigation logic.</p>\r\n<p>As an example of this, in the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921074(v=PandP.40).aspx\">\r\nStock Trader Reference Implementation QuickStart</a>, you can find the <strong>AnimatedTabControl</strong> class (which inherits from the\r\n<strong>TabControl</strong> class), which shows you an implementation for the transition between the tabs of the\r\n<em>control</em>. You could use this code as a guide to the approach of the animations your application requires.</p>\r\n<p>Also, you might find handy the Animation Overview article on MSDN <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752312.aspx\">\r\nhere</a>.</p>\r\n<p>I hope you find this information useful.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Miguel Bronzovic<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic\">http://blogs.southworks.net/mbronzovic</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
