My idea would be that if they were supplied they would be used as is the current behaviour, though if not used then the following would occur<br>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Use reflection to get the assembly file specified in config file.</li>\r\n    <li>If <em>moduleType</em> was specified in config file use that to get the type from the assembly other wise use reflection to find the first implementation of <em>IModule</em>.</li>\r\n    <li>Once the type has been found use <em>ModuleName</em> from <em>ModuleAttribute</em> if it was not specified in the config file.</li>\r\n    <li>If <em>startupLoaded</em> was also not specified look to see if <em>StartupLoaded</em> is true against <em>ModuleAttribute</em>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis way the App.config would serve as an override to the behaviour specified in the module and would only require the <em>assemblyFile</em> to be specified. I tried to give it a bit of a go looking at the code used in the <em>DirectoryLookupModuleEnumerator</em> but my lack of knowledge with <em>AppDomain</em> is limiting me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be a nice to have feature with no great deal of importance. If I do manage to nail it in my spare time I'll post my results.<br>\r\n-Brett<br>\r\n<br>\r\n",
