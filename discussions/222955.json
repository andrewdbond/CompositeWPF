So I'm using MefBootstapper as the base for my bootstrapper.\r\nThere's ConfigureContainer method in MefBootstrapper with such code:\r\n[code]\r\n    this.Container.ComposeExportedValue&lt;ILoggerFacade&gt;(this.Logger);\r\n    this.Container.ComposeExportedValue&lt;IModuleCatalog&gt;(this.ModuleCatalog);\r\n    this.Container.ComposeExportedValue&lt;IServiceLocator&gt;(new MefServiceLocatorAdapter(this.Container));\r\n[/code]\r\n\r\nHere we (you) register a wrapper for well-known IServiceLocator implementation. \r\n\r\nThen in another method, ConfigureServiceLocator, we set up a IServiceLocator-implementation from the Container as &quot;global&quot; Service Locator :\r\n[code]\r\n        protected override void ConfigureServiceLocator()\r\n        {\r\n            IServiceLocator serviceLocator = this.Container.GetExportedValue&lt;IServiceLocator&gt;();\r\n            ServiceLocator.SetLocatorProvider(() =&gt; serviceLocator);\r\n        }\r\n[/code]\r\nMefBootstapper.Run's logic sequence is : ConfigureContainer -&gt; ConfigureServiceLocator\r\n\r\n\r\nThen in some module I call:\r\nvar f = ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance&lt;ILoggerFacade&gt;();\r\nand got this exception:\r\nActivationException: Activation error occured while trying to get instance of type ILoggerFacade, key &quot;&quot;/\r\n\r\n\r\nActually I ask not for ILoggerFacade, it's just for an example. The key point here is that I ask for an interface which implementation I registered in ConfigureContainer as &quot;Container.ComposeExportedValue&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand that I can get all required references in my module's constructor (via ImportingConstructor), but :\r\n1) ServiceLocator-approach should work too, doesn't?\r\n2) I have a base class for all my modules and don't want to burden all their constructors with additional parameters (which should be just transfered to base ctor)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm using Prism v4 CTP (August).",
