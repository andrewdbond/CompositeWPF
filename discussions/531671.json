I realise it's only beta, but e.g. not even RegisterPrismBinaries.bat is present, and the readme instructions for setting up still only refer to 4.1.<br />\n\r<br />\nI have built the PrismLibrary solution and will manually browse the assemblies to set references, but I really think that even for a beta, the package itself is a rather poor effort and could have received more attention.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there any guidance on installing 4.2 anywhere else?<br />\n",
