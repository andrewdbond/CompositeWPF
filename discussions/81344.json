And the first question that I'm faced after reviewing StockTrader example is:<br>How can we say that our app's dependencies is loose coupled if or main assembly (StockTraderRI) is roughly dependent on modules assemblies: StockTraderRI.Modules.Market, StockTraderRI.Modules.News and so on? I understand, it's because we add&nbsp; modules in bootstrapper and we need to point type of module, so we need to reference assembly with this type. But doesn't it contradict with the loose coupling cardinally?</p>",
