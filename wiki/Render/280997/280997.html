<div class="wikidoc"><h2>Summary of the Problem</h2>The Prism v2.2/v4.0 setup application invokes a Windows Scripting Host script that uses the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb774085(VS.85).aspx">Shell.NameSpace</a> method to open the included Sources.zip file as a folder.  The script then iterates through all the content in the archive (treated as a folder) and extracts the content. The problem occurs when a non-default shell handler is enabled for zip files that does not support a folder view of the content, for example PKZip.  The failed folder view results in an error in the script and termination without extracting the content.<br />
<h2>Solution</h2>Set the windows support for Zip files as the default handler for files of the Zip type.  This can be accomplished by opening the properties for a zip file and changing the default handler.<br /><br /><img src="http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=CompositeWPF&DownloadId=127637" alt="zipfile.png" title="zipfile.png" /><br /><br />Selecting change and choosing Windows Compressed as the default handler instead of a third party handler that may not support a folder view will resolve the issue.</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
