<h2>Renamings &amp; Refactoring <a name="RenamingsRefactoring"></a></h2><ul><li>The <b>IModuleEnumerator.GetModule</b> method now returns a single <b>ModuleInfo</b> instance instead of an array.</li>
<li>Extracted base functionality from <b>WpfEvent</b> class to the <b>EventBase</b> base class to make it extensible.</li>
<li><b>WpfEvent</b> has been renamed to <b>CompositeWpfEvent</b>: The <b>CompositeWpfEvent</b> class is the only implementation of the <b>EventBase</b> class that comes out-of-the-box in the Composite Application Library. This class is in charge of connecting publishers and subscribers.</li>
<li>Merged (Collapsed) <b>ActiveAwareCompositeCommand</b> into <b>CompositeCommand</b>, and <b>ActiveAwareDelegateCommand</b> into <b>DelegateCommand</b>: When you want a command to execute only if it is in a view that is currently active (selected), make that command implement the <b>IActiveAware</b> interface. This interface has an <b>IsActive</b> property, which can be set when the command becomes active. Whenever the property changes, the command raises the <b>IsActiveChanged</b> event.</li>
<li>Created the <b>Composite.Tests</b> test project.</li>
<li>Added code comments.</li>
<li>Fixed issues.</li></ul>
