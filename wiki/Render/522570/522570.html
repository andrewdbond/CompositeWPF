<div class="wikidoc"><h2>Using resource dictionaries in modules</h2>
The most common issues regarding this subject are:<br /><br /><b>If a ResourceDictionary is defined in the Shell project, this ResourceDictionary will not be available in design time in a module. (In runtime, the ResourceDictionary will be resolved correctly)</b>:<br /><br />In this case, it would be worth noting that it’s possible to define application-wide resources out of the box, which will work in all modules. However, this doesn’t seem to work with the designer, when checking a view in a module. A possible work around would be to include the source path for the <b>ResourceDictionary</b> as a resource in the <b>App.xaml</b> file of the module doing something similar to this:<br /><br /><i>&lt;Application.Resources&gt;</i><br />    <i>&lt;ResourceDictionary Source=&quot;/ShellProject;component/Resources/Resource.xaml&quot;/&gt;</i><br /><i>&lt;/Application.Resources&gt;</i><br /><br />While the <b>App.xaml</b> file in a module isn’t consumed when running the application, it is used in design-time.<br /><br /><br /><b>If a ResourceDictionary is defined in a module (to be used specifically inside the module), the ResourceDictionary will not be available at runtime</b>:<br /><br />For this case, you might find the approach proposed in the following blog post by Guido Maliandi useful:
