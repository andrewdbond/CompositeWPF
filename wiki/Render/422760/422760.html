<h2>Event Aggregation</h2>
<p>The Prism Library provides an event mechanism that enables communications between loosely coupled components in the application. This mechanism, based on the event aggregator service, allows publishers and subscribers to communicate through events and still
 do not have a direct reference to each other. The<strong> EventAggregator</strong> provides multicast publish/subscribe functionality. This means there can be multiple publishers that raise the same event and there can be multiple subscribers listening to
 the same event. Consider using the <strong>EventAggregator</strong> to publish an event across modules and when sending a message between business logic code, such as controllers and presenters. Below you will find some resources that complement the information
